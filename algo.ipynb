With computers having become prevalent in \\nour modern lives, however, the term is no longer esoteric. If you look around your \\nhome, you’ll ûnd algorithms running in the most mundane places: your microwave \\noven, your washing machine, and, of course, your co mputer. You ask algorithms \\nto make recommendations to you: what music you migh t like or what route to \\ntake when driving. Our society, for better or for worse, asks algorithms to suggest \\nsentences for convicted criminals. You even rely on algorithms to keep you alive, \\nor at least not to kill you: the control systems in your car or in medical equipment. 1 \\nThe word <algorithm= appears somewhere in the news seemingly every day. \\nTherefore, it behooves you to understand algorithms  not just as a student or \\npractitioner of computer science, but as a citizen of the world. Once you understand \\nalgorithms, you can educate others about what algor ithms are, how they operate, \\nand what their limitations are. \\nThis book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of com- \\nputer algorithms. It presents many algorithms and c overs them in considerable \\ndepth, yet makes their design accessible to all lev els of readers. All the analyses \\nare laid out, some simple, some more involved. We have tried to keep explanations \\nclear without sacriûcing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. \\nEach chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a \\nrelated topic. Algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to \\nbe readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The book contains 231 \\nûgures4many with multiple parts4illustrating how the algorithms work. Since \\nwe emphasize efﬁciency as a design criterion, we include careful analyses of the \\nrunning times of the algorithms. \\n1 To understand many of the ways in which algorithms inüuence our daily lives, see the book by \\nFry [162].

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rokig\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Algo Generator\\\\data\\\\cormen book.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='xiv Preface \\nThe text is intended primarily for use in undergrad uate or graduate courses in \\nalgorithms or data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm \\ndesign, as well as mathematical aspects, it is equa lly well s uited for self-study by \\ntechnical professionals. \\nIn this, the fourth edition, we have once again upd ated the entire book. The \\nchanges cover a broad spectrum, including new chapters and s ections, color illus- \\ntrations, and what we hope you’ll ûnd to be a more engaging writing style. \\nTo the teacher \\nWe have designed this book to be both versatile and  complete. You should ûnd it \\nuseful for a variety of courses, from an undergraduate course in data structures up \\nthrough a graduate course in algorithms. Because we  have provided considerably \\nmore material than can ût in a typical one-term course, you can select the material \\nthat best supports the course you wish to teach. \\nYou should ûnd it easy to organize your course around just the chapters you \\nneed. We have made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not \\nworry about an unexpected and unnecessary dependenc e of one chapter on an- \\nother. Whereas in an undergraduate course, you migh t use only some sections \\nfrom a chapter, in a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter. \\nWe have included 931 exercises and 162 problems. Each section ends with exer- \\ncises, and each chapter ends with problems. The exercises are generally short ques- \\ntions that test basic mastery of the material. Some  are simpl e self-check thought \\nexercises, but many are substantial and suitable as assigned homework. The prob- \\nlems include more elaborate case studies which often introduce new material. They \\noften consist of several parts that lead the student through the steps required to ar- \\nrive at a solution. \\nAs with the third edition of this book, we have made publicly available solutions \\nto some, but by no means all, of the problems and exercises. You can ûnd these so- \\nlutions on our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/. You will want to check \\nthis site to see whether it contains the solution t o an exercise or problem that you \\nplan to assign. Since the set of solutions that we post might grow over time, we \\nrecommend that you check the site each time you teach the course. \\nWe have starred (?) the sections and exercises that are more suitable for graduate \\nstudents than for undergraduates. A starred section  is not n ecessarily more difû- \\ncult than an unstarred one, but it may require an u nderstanding of more advanced \\nmathematics. Likewise, starred exercises may require an advanced background or \\nmore than average creativity. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rokig\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Algo Generator\\\\data\\\\cormen book.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Preface xv \\nTo the student \\nWe hope that this textbook provides you with an enjoyable introduction to the ûeld \\nof algorithms. We have attempted to make every algo rithm acc essible and inter- \\nesting. To help you when you encounter unfamiliar or difûcult algorithms, we \\ndescribe each one in a step-by-step manner. We also provide careful explanations \\nof the mathematics needed to understand the analysi s of the a lgorithms and sup- \\nporting ûgures to help you visualize what is going on. \\nSince this book is large, your class will probably cover only a portion of its \\nmaterial. Although we hope that you will ûnd this book helpful to you as a course \\ntextbook now, we have also tried to make it comprehensive enough to warrant space \\non your future professional bookshelf. \\nWhat are the prerequisites for reading this book? \\n\\ue001 You need some programming experience. In particular, you should understand \\nrecursive procedures and simple data structures, such as arrays and linked lists \\n(although Section 10.2 covers linked lists and a variant that you may ûnd new). \\n\\ue001 You should have some facility with mathematical proofs, and especially proofs \\nby mathematical induction. A few portions of the book rely on some knowledge \\nof elementary calculus. Although this book uses mathematics throughout, Part I \\nand Appendices A–D teach you all the mathematical techniques you will need. \\nOur website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, links to solutions for some of \\nthe problems and exercises. Feel free to check your solutions against ours. We ask, \\nhowever, that you not send your solutions to us. \\nTo the professional \\nThe wide range of topics in this book makes it an e xcellent han dbook on algo- \\nrithms. Because each chapter is relatively self-contained, you can focus on the \\ntopics most relevant to you. \\nSince most of the algorithms we discuss have great practical utility, we address \\nimplementation concerns and other engineering issues. We often provide practical \\nalternatives to the few algorithms that are primarily of theoretical interest. \\nIf you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should ûnd the transla- \\ntion of our pseudocode into your favorite programmi ng language to be a fairly \\nstraightforward task. We have designed the pseudocode to present each algorithm \\nclearly and succinctly. Consequently, we do not add ress error handling and other \\nsoftware-engineering issues that require speciûc assumptions about your program- \\nming environment. We attempt to present each algorithm simply and directly with- \\nout allowing the idiosyncrasies of a particular programming language to obscure its \\nessence. If you are used to 0-origin arrays, you might ûnd our frequent practice of '),\n",

You can always either subtract 1 \\nfrom our indices or just overallocate the array and leave position 0 unused. \\nWe understand that if you are using this book outsi de of a course, then you \\nmight be unable to check your solutions to problems and exercises against solutions \\nprovided by an instructor. Our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, links \\nto solutions for some of the problems and exercises  so that you can check your \\nwork. Please do not send your solutions to us. \\nTo our colleagues \\nWe have supplied an extensive bibliography and pointers to the current literature. \\nEach chapter ends with a set of chapter notes that give historical details and ref- \\nerences. The chapter notes do not provide a complet e reference to the whole ûeld \\nof algorithms, however. Though it may be hard to be lieve for a book of this size, \\nspace constraints prevented us from including many interesting algorithms. \\nDespite myriad requests from students for solutions  to problems and exercises, \\nwe have adopted the policy of not citing references  for them, removing the temp- \\ntation for students to look up a solution rather than to discover it themselves. \\nChanges for the fourth edition \\nAs we said about the changes for the second and third editions, depending on how \\nyou look at it, the book changed either not much or quite a bit. A quick look at the \\ntable of contents shows that most of the third-edition chapters and sections appear \\nin the fourth edition. We removed three chapters and several sections, but we have \\nadded three new chapters and several new sections apart from these new chapters. \\nWe kept the hybrid organization from the ûrst three editions. Rather than \\norganizing chapters only by problem domains or only  according to techniques, \\nthis book incorporates elements of both. It contain s technique-based chapters on \\ndivide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analy- \\nsis, augmenting data structures, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. \\nBut it also has entire parts on sorting, on data st ructures for dynamic sets, and on \\nalgorithms for graph problems. We ûnd that although you need to know how to ap- \\nply techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms, problems seldom announce \\nto you which techniques are most amenable to solving them. \\nSome of the changes in the fourth edition apply gen erally across the book, and \\nsome are speciûc to particular chapters or sections. Here is a summary of the most \\nsigniûcant general changes: \\n\\ue001 We added 140 new exercises and 22 new problems. We also improved many of \\nthe old exercises and problems, often as the result of reader feedback. (Thanks \\nto all readers who made suggestions.) '),\n",

With designers from the MIT Press, w e selected a limited \\npalette, devised to convey information and to be pl easing to the eye. (We are \\ndelighted to display red-black trees in4get this4red and black!) To enhance \\nreadability, deûned terms, pseudocode comments, and page numbers in the in- \\ndex are in color. \\n\\ue001 Pseudocode procedures appear on a tan background to make them easier to spot, \\nand they do not necessarily appear on the page of their ûrst reference. When \\nthey don’t, the text directs you to the relevant page. In the same vein, nonlocal \\nreferences to numbered equations, theorems, lemmas,  and corollaries include \\nthe page number. \\n\\ue001 We removed topics that were rarely taught. We dropp ed in their entirety the \\nchapters on Fibonacci heaps, van Emde Boas trees, a nd computational geom- \\netry. In addition, the following material was excis ed: the m aximum-subarray \\nproblem, implementing pointers and objects, perfect  hashing, randomly built \\nbinary search trees, matroids, push-relabel algorithms for maximum üow, the \\niterative fast Fourier transform method, the details of the simplex algorithm for \\nlinear programming, and integer factorization. You can ûnd all the removed \\nmaterial on our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/. \\n\\ue001 We reviewed the entire book and rewrote sentences, paragraphs, and sections \\nto make the writing clearer, more personal, and gen der neutral. For example, \\nthe <traveling-salesman problem= in the previous editions is now called the \\n<traveling-salesperson problem.= We believe that it is critically important for \\nengineering and science, including our own ûeld of computer science, to be \\nwelcoming to everyone. (The one place that stumped us is in Chapter 13, which \\nrequires a term for a parent’s sibling.

You also need some mathematical tools to show \\nthat your algorithms do the right thing and do it efûciently. This part will get you \\nstarted. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. \\nChapter 1 provides an overview of algorithms and their place in modern com- \\nputing systems. This chapter deûnes what an algorithm is and lists some examples. \\nIt also makes a case for considering algorithms as a technology, alongside tech- \\nnologies such as fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, \\nand networks. \\nIn Chapter 2, we see our ûrst algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting \\na sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, al though not \\ndirectly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the struc- \\nture of the algorithm clearly enough that you should be able to implement it in the \\nlanguage of your choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, \\nwhich uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive tech- \\nnique known as <divide-and-conquer.= Although the time each requires increases \\nwith the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algo rithms. We \\ndetermine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful <asymptotic= \\nnotation to express them. \\nChapter 3 precisely deûnes asymptotic notation. We’ll use asymptotic notation \\nto bound the growth of functions4most often, functions that describe the running \\ntime of algorithms4from above and below. The chapter starts by informally deûn- \\ning the most commonly used asymptotic notations and giving an example of how to \\napply them. It then formally deûnes ûve asymptotic notations and presents conven- \\ntions for how to put them together. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation \\nof mathematical notation, more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in \\nthis book than to teach you new mathematical concepts.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rokig\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Algo Generator\\\\data\\\\cormen book.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='4 Part I Foundations \\nChapter 4 delves further into the divide-and-conquer method introduced in \\nChapter 2. It provides two additional examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms \\nfor multiplying square matrices, including Strassen’s surprising method. Chapter 4 \\ncontains methods for solving recurrences, which are useful for describing the run- \\nning times of recursive algorithms. In the substitution method, you guess an answer \\nand prove it correct. Recursion trees provide one w ay to generate a guess. Chap- \\nter 4 also presents the powerful technique of the <master method,= which you can \\noften use to solve recurrences that arise from divide-and-conquer algorithms. Al- \\nthough the chapter provides a proof of a foundational theorem on which the master \\ntheorem depends, you should feel free to employ the master method without delv- \\ning into the proof. Chapter 4 concludes with some advanced topics. \\nChapter 5 introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. You \\ntypically use probabilistic analysis to determine t he running time of an algorithm \\nin cases in which, due to the presence of an inhere nt probability distribution, the \\nrunning time may differ on different inputs of the same size. In some cases, you \\nmight assume that the inputs conform to a known pro bability distribution, so that \\nyou are averaging the running time over all possibl e inputs. In other cases, the \\nprobability distribution comes not from the inputs but from random choices made \\nduring the course of the algorithm. An algorithm wh ose behavior is determined \\nnot only by its input but by the values produced by a random-number generator is a \\nrandomized algorithm. You can use randomized algorithms to enforce a probability \\ndistribution on the inputs4thereby ensuring that no particular input always causes \\npoor performance4or even to bound the error rate of algorithms that are allowed \\nto produce incorrect results on a limited basis. \\nAppendices A–D contain other mathematical material that you will ûnd helpful \\nas you read this book. You might have seen much of the material in the appendix \\nchapters before having read this book (although the speciûc deûnitions and nota- \\ntional conventions we use may differ in some cases from what you have seen in \\nthe past), and so you should think of the appendices as reference material. On the \\nother hand, you probably have not already seen most of the material in Part I. All \\nthe chapters in Part I and the appendices are written with a tutorial üavor. '),\n",

Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile? What is the role \\nof algorithms relative to other technologies used i n computers? This chapter will \\nanswer these questions. \\n1.1 Algorithms \\nInformally, an algorithm is any well-deûned computational procedure that takes \\nsome value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as \\noutput in a ûnite amount of time. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational \\nsteps that transform the input into the output. \\nYou can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciûed computa- \\ntional problem. The statement of the problem speciûes in general terms the desired \\ninput/output relationship for problem instances, ty pically of arbitrarily large size. \\nThe algorithm describes a speciûc computational procedure for achieving that in- \\nput/output relationship for all problem instances. \\nAs an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into mono- \\ntonically increasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides \\nfertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. \\nHere is how we formally deûne the sorting problem: \\nInput: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  n i. \\nOutput: A permutation (reordering) ha 0 \\n1 ;a 0 \\n2 ;:::;a  0 \\nn i of the input sequence such \\nthat a 0 \\n1 හ a 0 \\n2 හ \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 හ a 0 \\nn . \\nThus, given the input sequence h31;41;59;26;41;58 i, a correct sorting algorithm \\nreturns as output the sequence h26;31;41;41;58;59 i. Such an input sequence is '),\n",

In general, an instance of a problem 1 \\nconsists of the input (satisfying whatever constrai nts are imposed in the problem \\nstatement) needed to compute a solution to the problem. \\nBecause many programs use it as an intermediate step, sorting is a fundamental \\noperation in computer science. As a result, you hav e a large number of good sort- \\ning algorithms at your disposal. Which algorithm is  best for a given application \\ndepends on4among other factors4the number of items to be sorted, the extent \\nto which the items are already somewhat sorted, pos sible restrictions on the item \\nvalues, the architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used: \\nmain memory, disks, or even4archaically4tapes. \\nAn algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem in- \\nstance provided as input, it halts4ûnishes its computing in ûnite time4and out- \\nputs the correct solution to the problem instance. A correct algorithm solves the \\ngiven computational problem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some \\ninput instances, or it might halt with an incorrect  answer. Contrary to what you \\nmight expect, incorrect algorithms can sometimes be  useful, if you can control \\ntheir error rate. We’ll see an example of an algorithm with a controllable error rate \\nin Chapter 31 when we study algorithms for ûnding large prime numbers. Ordi- \\nnarily, however, we’ll concern ourselves only with correct algorithms. \\nAn algorithm can be speciûed in English, as a computer program, or even as \\na hardware design. The only requirement is that the speciûcation must provide a \\nprecise description of the computational procedure to be followed. \\nWhat kinds of problems are solved by algorithms? \\nSorting is by no means the only computational problem for which algorithms have \\nbeen developed. (You probably suspected as much whe n you saw the size of this \\nbook.) Practical applications of algorithms are ubi quitous and include the follow- \\ning examples: \\n\\ue001 The Human Genome Project has made great progress toward the goals of iden- \\ntifying all the roughly 30,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequences \\nof the roughly 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, stor- \\ning this information in databases, and developing tools for data analysis. Each \\nof these steps requires sophisticated algorithms. A lthough the solutions to the \\nvarious problems involved are beyond the scope of this book, many methods to \\nsolve these biological problems use ideas presented here, enabling scientists to \\naccomplish tasks while using resources efûciently.

The savings realized are in time, both h uman and machine, and in \\nmoney, as more information can be extracted by laboratory techniques. \\n\\ue001 The internet enables people all around the world to quickly access and retrieve \\nlarge amounts of information. With the aid of cleve r algorithms, sites on the \\ninternet are able to manage and manipulate this lar ge volume of data. Exam- \\nples of problems that make essential use of algorit hms inclu de ûnding good \\nroutes on which the data travels (techniques for so lving such problems appear \\nin Chapter 22), and using a search engine to quickly ûnd pages on which par- \\nticular information resides (related techniques are in Chapters 11 and 32). \\n\\ue001 Electronic commerce enables goods and services to b e negoti ated and ex- \\nchanged electronically, and it depends on the priva cy of per sonal informa- \\ntion such as credit card numbers, passwords, and ba nk statements. The core \\ntechnologies used in electronic commerce include public-key cryptography and \\ndigital signatures (covered in Chapter 31), which are based on numerical algo- \\nrithms and number theory. \\n\\ue001 Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises ofte n need to allocate scarce \\nresources in the most beneûcial way. An oil company might wish to know \\nwhere to place its wells in order to maximize its e xpected proût. A political \\ncandidate might want to determine where to spend money buying campaign ad- \\nvertising in order to maximize the chances of winni ng an election. An airline \\nmight wish to assign crews to üights in the least expensive way possible, mak- \\ning sure that each üight is covered and that government regulations regarding \\ncrew scheduling are met. An internet service provider might wish to determine \\nwhere to place additional resources in order to ser ve its customers more effec- \\ntively. All of these are examples of problems that can be solved by modeling \\nthem as linear programs, which Chapter 29 explores. \\nAlthough some of the details of these examples are beyond the scope of this \\nbook, we do give underlying techniques that apply to these problems and problem \\nareas. We also show how to solve many speciûc problems, including the following: \\n\\ue001 You have a road map on which the distance between e ach pair of a djacent in- \\ntersections is marked, and you wish to determine th e shortest route from one \\nintersection to another. The number of possible routes can be huge, even if you \\ndisallow routes that cross over themselves. How can  you choose which of all \\npossible routes is the shortest? You can start by modeling the road map (which \\nis itself a model of the actual roads) as a graph ( which we will meet in Part VI \\nand Appendix B). In this graph, you wish to ûnd the shortest path from one \\nvertex to another. Chapter 22 shows how to solve this problem efûciently. '),\n",

If the design compris es n parts, then there are nŠ \\npossible orders, where nŠ denotes the factorial function. Because the factori al \\nfunction grows faster than even an exponential func tion, you cannot feasibly \\ngenerate each possible order and then verify that, within that order, each part \\nappears before the parts using it (unless you have only a few parts). This prob- \\nlem is an instance of topological sorting, and Chap ter 20 shows how to solve \\nthis problem efûciently. \\n\\ue001 A doctor needs to determine whether an image represents a cancerous tumor or \\na benign one. The doctor has available images of ma ny other tumors, some of \\nwhich are known to be cancerous and some of which a re known to be benign. \\nA cancerous tumor is likely to be more similar to o ther cancerous tumors than \\nto benign tumors, and a benign tumor is more likely  to be simil ar to other be- \\nnign tumors. By using a clustering algorithm, as in Chapter 33, the doctor can \\nidentify which outcome is more likely. \\n\\ue001 You need to compress a large ûle containing text so that it occupies less space. \\nMany ways to do so are known, including <LZW compression,= which looks for \\nrepeating character sequences. Chapter 15 studies a different approach, <Huff- \\nman coding,= which encodes characters by bit sequen ces of various lengths, \\nwith characters occurring more frequently encoded by shorter bit sequences. \\nThese lists are far from exhaustive (as you again h ave probably surmised from \\nthis book’s heft), but they exhibit two characteristics common to many interesting \\nalgorithmic problems: \\n1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do \\nnot solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is <best,= with- \\nout explicitly examining each possible solution, can present quite a challenge. \\n2. They have practical applications. Of the problems in the above list, ûnding the \\nshortest path provides the easiest examples. A tran sportation ûrm, such as a \\ntrucking or railroad company, has a ûnancial interest in ûnding shortest paths \\nthrough a road or rail network because taking short er paths results in lower \\nlabor and fuel costs. Or a routing node on the internet might need to ûnd the \\nshortest path through the network in order to route  a message quickly. Or a \\nperson wishing to drive from New York to Boston might want to ûnd driving \\ndirections using a navigation app. \\nNot every problem solved by algorithms has an easily identiûed set of candi- \\ndate solutions. For example, given a set of numerical values representing samples \\nof a signal taken at regular time intervals, the di screte Fourier transform converts '),\n",

That is, it approximates the signal as a \\nweighted sum of sinusoids, producing the strength o f various frequencies which, \\nwhen summed, approximate the sampled signal. In addition to lying at the heart of \\nsignal processing, discrete Fourier transforms have  applications in data compres- \\nsion and multiplying large polynomials and integers. Chapt er 30 gives an efûcient \\nalgorithm, the fast Fourier transform (commonly called the FFT), for this problem. \\nThe chapter also sketches out the design of a hardware FFT circuit. \\nData structures \\nThis book also presents several data structures. A \\ndata structure is a way to store \\nand organize data in order to facilitate access and modiûcations. Using the appro- \\npriate data structure or structures is an important part of algorithm design. No sin- \\ngle data structure works well for all purposes, and so you should know the strengths \\nand limitations of several of them. \\nTechnique \\nAlthough you can use this book as a <cookbook= for algorithms, you might some- \\nday encounter a problem for which you cannot readily ûnd a published algorithm \\n(many of the exercises and problems in this book, f or example). This book will \\nteach you techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop al- \\ngorithms on your own, show that they give the correct answer, and analyze their ef- \\nûciency. Different chapters address different aspects of algorithmic problem solv- \\ning. Some chapters address speciûc problems, such as ûnding medians and order \\nstatistics in Chapter 9, computing minimum spanning trees in Chapter 21, and de- \\ntermining a maximum üow in a network in Chapter 24. Other chapters introduce \\ntechniques, such as divide-and-conquer in Chapters 2 and 4, dynamic programming \\nin Chapter 14, and amortized analysis in Chapter 16. \\nHard problems \\nMost of this book is about efûcient algorithms. Our usual measure of efûciency \\nis speed: how long does an algorithm take to produc e its resul t? There are some \\nproblems, however, for which we know of no algorith m that runs in a reasonable \\namount of time. Chapter 34 studies an interesting subset of these problems, which \\nare known as NP-complete. \\nWhy are NP-complete problems interesting? First, although no efûcient algo- \\nrithm for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven \\nthat an efûcient algorithm for one cannot exist. In other words, no one knows \\nwhether efûcient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems. Second, the set of '),\n",

This re- \\nlationship among the NP-complete problems makes the lack of efûcient solutions \\nall the more tantalizing. Third, several NP-complete problems are similar, but not \\nidentical, to problems for which we do know of efûcient algorithms. Computer \\nscientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause \\na big change to the efûciency of the best known algorithm. \\nYou should know about NP-complete problems because some of them arise sur- \\nprisingly often in real applications. If you are ca lled upon to produce an efûcient \\nalgorithm for an NP-complete problem, you are likely to spend a lot of time in a \\nfruitless search. If, instead, you can show that th e problem is NP-complete, you \\ncan spend your time developing an efûcient approximation algorithm, that is, an \\nalgorithm that gives a good, but not necessarily the best possible, solution. \\nAs a concrete example, consider a delivery company with a central depot. Each \\nday, it loads up delivery trucks at the depot and sends them around to deliver goods \\nto several addresses. At the end of the day, each truck must end up back at the depot \\nso that it is ready to be loaded for the next day. To reduce costs, the company wants \\nto select an order of delivery stops that yields the lowest overall distance traveled by \\neach truck. This problem is the well-known <traveling-salesperson problem,= and it \\nis NP-complete. 2 It has no known efûcient algorithm. Under certain assumptions, \\nhowever, we know of efûcient algorithms that compute overall distances close to \\nthe smallest possible. Chapter 35 discusses such <approximation algorithms.= \\nAlternative computing models \\nFor many years, we could count on processor clock s peeds increasing at a steady \\nrate. Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever-increasing clock \\nspeeds, however: because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed, \\nchips run the risk of melting once their clock spee ds become h igh enough. In or- \\nder to perform more computations per second, therefore, chips are being designed \\nto contain not just one but several processing <cor es.= We ca n liken these multi- \\ncore computers to several sequential computers on a  single chip.

For many important real-world examples, however, the input \\nactually arrives over time, and the algorithm must decide how to proceed without \\nknowing what data will arrive in the future.

The answer is yes, if for no other reason than that \\nyou would still like to be certain that your solution method terminates and does so \\nwith the correct answer. \\nIf computers were inûnitely fast, any correct method for solving a problem \\nwould do. You would probably want your implementation to be within the bounds \\nof good software engineering practice (for example,  your implementation should \\nbe well designed and documented), but you would mos t often use whichever \\nmethod was the easiest to implement. \\nOf course, computers may be fast, but they are not inûnitely fast. Computing \\ntime is therefore a bounded resource, which makes it precious. Although the saying \\ngoes, <Time is money,= time is even more valuable than money: you can get back \\nmoney after you spend it, but once time is spent, you can never get it back. Memory \\nmay be inexpensive, but it is neither inûnite nor free. You should choose algorithms \\nthat use the resources of time and space efûciently. \\nEfûciency \\nDifferent algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in \\ntheir efûciency. These differences can be much more signiûcant than differences \\ndue to hardware and software. \\nAs an example, Chapter 2 introduces two algorithms for sorti ng. The ûrst, \\nknown as insertion sort, takes time roughly equal to c 1 n 2 to sort n items, where c 1 \\nis a constant that does not depend on n. That is, it takes time roughly proportional \\nto n 2 . The second, merge sort, takes time roughly equal to c 2 n lg n, where lg n \\nstands for log 2 n and c 2 is another constant that also does not depend on n. Inser- \\ntion sort typically has a smaller constant factor t han merge sort, so that c 1 < c 2 . \\nWe’ll see that the constant factors can have far less of an impact on the running \\ntime than the dependence on the input size n. Let’s write insertion sort’s running \\ntime as c 1 n \\ue001 n and merge sort’s running time as c 2 n \\ue001 lg n. Then we see that where \\ninsertion sort has a factor of n in its running time, merge sort has a factor of lg n, \\nwhich is much smaller. For example, when n is 1000, lg n is approximately 10, and \\nwhen n is 1,000,000, lg n is approximately only 20. Although insertion sort usu- \\nally runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes, once the input size n becomes \\nlarge enough, merge sort’s advantage of lg n versus n more than compensates for \\nthe difference in constant factors. No matter how much smaller c 1 is than c 2 , there \\nis always a crossover point beyond which merge sort is faster. '),\n",

They each \\nmust sort an array of 10 million numbers. (Although 10 million numbers might \\nseem like a lot, if the numbers are eight-byte integers, then the input occupies \\nabout 80 megabytes, which ûts in the memory of even an inexpensive laptop com- \\nputer many times over.) Suppose that computer A executes 10 billion instructions \\nper second (faster than any single sequential compu ter at the time of this writing) \\nand computer B executes only 10 million instructions per second (much slower \\nthan most contemporary computers), so that computer A is 1000 times faster than \\ncomputer B in raw computing power. To make the difference even more dramatic, \\nsuppose that the world’s craftiest programmer codes insertion sort in machine lan- \\nguage for computer A, and the resulting code requir es 2n 2 instructions to sort n \\nnumbers. Suppose further that just an average progr ammer implements merge \\nsort, using a high-level language with an inefûcient compiler, with the resulting \\ncode taking 50n lg n instructions. To sort 10 million numbers, computer A takes \\n2 \\ue001 .10 7 / 2 instructions \\n10 10 instructions/second D 20,000 seconds (more than 5:5 hours) ; \\nwhile computer B takes \\n50 \\ue001 10 7 lg 10 7 instructions \\n10 7 instructions/second \\ue002 1163 seconds (under 20 minutes) : \\nBy using an algorithm whose running time grows more  slowly, even with a poor \\ncompiler, computer B runs more than 17 times faster than computer A! The ad- \\nvantage of merge sort is even more pronounced when sorting 100 million numbers: \\nwhere insertion sort takes more than 23 days, merge sort takes under four hours. \\nAlthough 100 million might seem like a large number, there are more than 100 mil- \\nlion web searches every half hour, more than 100 million emails sent every minute, \\nand some of the smallest galaxies (known as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies) con- \\ntain about 100 million stars. In general, as the problem size incr eases, so does the \\nrelative advantage of merge sort. \\nAlgorithms and other technologies \\nThe example above shows that you should consider algorithms, like computer hard- \\nware, as a \\ntechnology. Total system performance depends on choosing efûcient \\nalgorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware. Just as rapid advances are being \\nmade in other computer technologies, they are being made in algorithms as well. \\nYou might wonder whether algorithms are truly that important on contemporary \\ncomputers in light of other advanced technologies, such as '),\n",

It is self-contained, but it does \\ninclude several references to material that will be  introduced in Chapters 3 and 4. \\n(It also contains several summations, which Appendix A shows how to solve.) \\nWe’ll begin by examining the insertion sort algorithm to solve the sorting prob- \\nlem introduced in Chapter 1. We’ll specify algorithms using a pseudocode that \\nshould be understandable to you if you have done co mputer programming. We’ll \\nsee why insertion sort correctly sorts and analyze its running time. The analysis \\nintroduces a notation that describes how running ti me increases with the number \\nof items to be sorted. Following a discussion of in sertion sort, we’ll use a method \\ncalled divide-and-conquer to develop a sorting algorithm called merge sort. We’ll \\nend with an analysis of merge sort’s running time. \\n2.1 Insertion sort \\nOur ûrst algorithm, insertion sort, solves the sorting problem introduced in Chap- \\nter 1: \\nInput: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  n i. \\nOutput: A permutation (reordering) ha 0 \\n1 ;a 0 \\n2 ;:::;a  0 \\nn i of the input sequence such \\nthat a 0 \\n1 හ a 0 \\n2 හ \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 හ a 0 \\nn . \\nThe numbers to be sorted are also known as the keys. Although the problem is con- \\nceptually about sorting a sequence, the input comes  in the form of an array with \\nn elements. When we want to sort numbers, it’s often because they are the keys \\nassociated with other data, which we call satellite data. Together, a key and satel- \\nlite data form a record. For example, consider a spreadsheet containing st udent \\nrecords with many associated pieces of data such as age, grade-point average, and \\nnumber of courses taken. Any one of these quantities could be a key, but when the '),\n",

We can’t list \\nthem all.) If you have been introduced to any of these languages, you should have \\nlittle trouble understanding algorithms <coded= in pseudocode. What separates \\npseudocode from real code is that in pseudocode, we  employ wh atever expres- \\nsive method is most clear and concise to specify a given algorithm. Sometimes \\nthe clearest method is English, so do not be surpri sed if you c ome across an En- \\nglish phrase or sentence embedded within a section that looks more like real code. \\nAnother difference between pseudocode and real code is that pseudocode often ig- \\nnores aspects of software engineering4such as data abstraction, modularity, and \\nerror handling4in order to convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely. \\nWe start with insertion sort, which is an efûcient algorithm for sorting a small \\nnumber of elements. Insertion sort works the way you might sort a hand of playing \\ncards. Start with an empty left hand and the cards in a pile on the table. Pick up \\nthe ûrst card in the pile and hold it with your left hand. Then, with your right hand, \\nremove one card at a time from the pile, and insert  it into the correct position in \\nyour left hand. As Figure 2.1 illustrates, you ûnd the correct position for a card \\nby comparing it with each of the cards already in y our left hand, starting at the \\nright and moving left. As soon as you see a card in  your left hand whose value is \\nless than or equal to the card you’re holding in your right hand, insert the card that \\nyou’re holding in your right hand just to the right of this card in your left hand. If \\nall the cards in your left hand have values greater than the card in your right hand, \\nthen place this card as the leftmost card in your l eft hand. At all times, the cards \\nheld in your left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of \\nthe pile on the table. \\nThe pseudocode for insertion sort is given as the p rocedure I NSERTION -SORT \\non the facing page. It takes two parameters: an arr ay A containing the values to \\nbe sorted and the number n of values of sort. The values occupy positions AŒ1� \\nthrough AŒn� of the array, which we denote by AŒ1 W n�. When the I NSERTION - \\nSORT procedure is ûnished, array AŒ1 W n� contains the original values, but in sorted \\norder. \\n1 If you’re familiar with only Python, you can think of arrays as similar to Python lists.

When you’re \\nusing a loop invariant, you need to show three things: \\nInitialization: It is true prior to the ûrst iteration of the loop. \\nMaintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it r emains true before \\nthe next iteration. \\nTermination: The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant4usually \\nalong with the reason that the loop terminated4gives us a useful property that \\nhelps show that the algorithm is correct. \\nWhen the ûrst two properties hold, the loop invariant is true prior to every iteration \\nof the loop. (Of course, you are free to use established facts other than the loop \\ninvariant itself to prove that the loop invariant remains true before each iteration.) \\nA loop-invariant proof is a form of mathematical induction, where to prove that a \\nproperty holds, you prove a base case and an inductive step. Here, showing that the \\ninvariant holds before the ûrst iteration corresponds to the base case, and showing \\nthat the invariant holds from iteration to iteration corresponds to the inductive step. \\nThe third property is perhaps the most important on e, since you are using the \\nloop invariant to show correctness. Typically, you use the loop invariant along with \\nthe condition that caused the loop to terminate. Ma thematical induction typically \\napplies the inductive step inûnitely, but in a loop invariant the <induction= stops \\nwhen the loop terminates. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rokig\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Algo Generator\\\\data\\\\cormen book.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='2.1 Insertion sort 21 \\nLet’s see how these properties hold for insertion sort. \\nInitialization: We start by showing that the loop invariant holds before the ûrst \\nloop iteration, when i D 2. 2 The subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1� consists of just the \\nsingle element AŒ1�, which is in fact the original element in AŒ1�. Moreover, \\nthis subarray is sorted (after all, how could a sub array with just one value not \\nbe sorted?), which shows that the loop invariant holds prior to the ûrst iteration \\nof the loop. \\nMaintenance: Next, we tackle the second property: showing that e ach iteration \\nmaintains the loop invariant. Informally, the body of the for loop works by \\nmoving the values in AŒi \\ue003 1�, AŒi \\ue003 2�, AŒi \\ue003 3�, and so on by one position \\nto the right until it ûnds the proper position for AŒi� (lines 437), at which point \\nit inserts the value of AŒi� (line 8). The subarray AŒ1 W i� then consists of the \\nelements originally in AŒ1 W i�, but in sorted order. Incrementing i (increasing \\nits value by 1) for the next iteration of the for loop then preserves the loop \\ninvariant. \\nA more formal treatment of the second property would require us to state and \\nshow a loop invariant for the while loop of lines 537. Let’s not get bogged \\ndown in such formalism just yet. Instead, we’ll rely on our informal analysis to \\nshow that the second property holds for the outer loop. \\nTermination: Finally, we examine loop termination. The loop vari able i starts \\nat 2 and increases by 1 in each iteration. Once i ’s value exceeds n in line 1, the \\nloop terminates. That is, the loop terminates once i equals n C 1. Substituting \\nn C 1 for i in the wording of the loop invariant yields that the subarray AŒ1 W n� \\nconsists of the elements originally in AŒ1 W n�, but in sorted order. Hence, the \\nalgorithm is correct. \\nThis method of loop invariants is used to show corr ectness in various places \\nthroughout this book. \\nPseudocode conventions \\nWe use the following conventions in our pseudocode. \\n\\ue001 Indentation indicates block structure. For example, the body of the for loop that \\nbegins on line 1 consists of lines 238, and the body of the while loop that \\n2 When the loop is a for loop, the loop-invariant check just prior to the ûrst iteration occurs immedi- \\nately after the initial assignment to the loop-counter variable and just before the ûrst test in the loop \\nheader.

Our indentation style applies \\nto if-else statements 3 as well. Using indentation instead of textual indic ators \\nof block structure, such as begin and end statements or curly braces, reduces \\nclutter while preserving, or even enhancing, clarity. 4 \\n\\ue001 The looping constructs while, for, and repeat-until and the if-else conditional \\nconstruct have interpretations similar to those in C, C++, Java, Python, and \\nJavaScript. 5 In this book, the loop counter retains its value af ter the loop is \\nexited, unlike some situations that arise in C++ and Java. Thus, immediately \\nafter a for loop, the loop counter’s value is the value that ûrst exceeded the for \\nloop bound. 6 We used this property in our correctness argument f or insertion \\nsort. The for loop header in line 1 is for i D 2 to n, and so when this loop \\nterminates, i equals nC1. We use the keyword to when a for loop increments its \\nloop counter in each iteration, and we use the keyword downto when a for loop \\ndecrements its loop counter (reduces its value by 1 in each iteration). When \\nthe loop counter changes by an amount greater than 1, the amount of change \\nfollows the optional keyword by. \\n\\ue001 The symbol </ /= indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment. \\n\\ue001 Variables (such as i , j , and key) are local to the given procedure. We won’t use \\nglobal variables without explicit indication. \\n\\ue001 We access array elements by specifying the array na me followed by the index \\nin square brackets. For example, AŒi� indicates the i th element of the array A. \\nAlthough many programming languages enforce 0-origin indexing for arrays (0 \\nis the smallest valid index), we choose whichever i ndexing scheme is clearest \\nfor human readers to understand. Because people usu ally start counting at 1, \\nnot 0, most4but not all4of the arrays in this book use 1-origin indexing. To be \\n3 In an if-else statement, we indent else at the same level as its matching if. The ûrst executable line \\nof an else clause appears on the same line as the keyword else. For multiway tests, we use elseif for \\ntests after the ûrst one. When it is the ûrst line in an else clause, an if statement appears on the line \\nfollowing else so that you do not misconstrue it as elseif. \\n4 Each pseudocode procedure in this book appears on o ne page so that you do not need to discern \\nlevels of indentation in pseudocode that is split across pages. \\n5 Most block-structured languages have equivalent constructs, though the exact syntax may differ. \\nPython lacks repeat-until loops, and its for loops operate differently from the for loops in this book. \\nThink of the pseudocode line <for i D 1 to n= as equivalent to <for i in range(1, n+1)= in Python. \\n6 In Python, the loop counter retains its value after  the loop is exited, but the value it retains is th e \\nvalue it had during the ûnal iteration of the for loop, rather than the value that exceeded the loop \\nbound.

You \\ncan either always subtract 1 from each index or allocate each array with one \\nextra position and just ignore position 0. \\nThe notation <W= denotes a subarray. Thus, AŒi W j� indicates the subarray of A \\nconsisting of the elements AŒi�;AŒi C 1�;:::;AŒj� . 7 We also use this notation \\nto indicate the bounds of an array, as we did earli er when discussing the array \\nAŒ1 W n�. \\n\\ue001 We typically organize compound data into objects, which are composed of \\nattributes. We access a particular attribute using the syntax  found in many \\nobject-oriented programming languages: the object name, followed by a dot, \\nfollowed by the attribute name. For example, if an object x has attribute f , we \\ndenote this attribute by x: f . \\nWe treat a variable representing an array or object  as a pointer (known as a \\nreference in some programming languages) to the dat a representing the array \\nor object. For all attributes f of an object x , setting y D x causes y: f to \\nequal x: f . Moreover, if we now set x: f D 3, then afterward not only does x: f \\nequal 3, but y: f equals 3 as well. In other words, x and y point to the same \\nobject after the assignment y D x . This way of treating arrays and objects is \\nconsistent with most contemporary programming languages. \\nOur attribute notation can <cascade.= For example, suppose that the attribute f \\nis itself a pointer to some type of object that has an attribute g. Then the notation \\nx: f : g is implicitly parenthesized as .x: f /: g. In other words, if we had assigned \\ny D x: f , then x: f : g is the same as y: g. \\nSometimes a pointer refers to no object at all. In this case, we give it the special \\nvalue NIL . \\n\\ue001 We pass parameters to a procedure by value: the called procedure receives its \\nown copy of the parameters, and if it assigns a value to a parameter, the change \\nis not seen by the calling procedure. When objects are pas sed, the pointer to \\nthe data representing the object is copied, but the object’s attributes are not. For \\nexample, if x is a parameter of a called procedure, the assignment x D y within \\n7 If you’re used to programming in Python, bear in mind that in this book, the subarray AŒi W j� \\nincludes the element AŒj�. In Python, the last element of AŒi W j� is AŒj \\ue003 1�. Python allows negative \\nindices, which count from the back end of the list. This book does not use negative array indices. '),\n",

The assignment \\nx: f D 3, however, is visible if the calling procedure has a pointer to the same \\nobject as x . Similarly, arrays are passed by pointer, so that a pointer to the array \\nis passed, rather than the entire array, and changes to individual array elements \\nare visible to the calling procedure. Again, most c ontemporary programming \\nlanguages work this way. \\n\\ue001 A return statement immediately transfers control back to the  point of call in \\nthe calling procedure. Most return statements also take a value to pass back to \\nthe caller. Our pseudocode differs from many programming languages in that \\nwe allow multiple values to be returned in a single  return statement without \\nhaving to create objects to package them together. 8 \\n\\ue001 The boolean operators <and= and <or= are short circuiting. That is, evaluate \\nthe expression < x and y = by ûrst evaluating x . If x evaluates to FALSE , then \\nthe entire expression cannot evaluate to TRUE , and therefore y is not evaluated. \\nIf, on the other hand, x evaluates to TRUE , y must be evaluated to determine \\nthe value of the entire expression. Similarly, in the expression <x or y = the ex- \\npression y is evaluated only if x evaluates to FALSE . Short-circuiting operators \\nallow us to write boolean expressions such as <x ¤ NIL and x: f D y = without \\nworrying about what happens upon evaluating x: f when x is NIL . \\n\\ue001 The keyword error indicates that an error occurred because conditions  were \\nwrong for the procedure to have been called, and th e procedure immediately \\nterminates. The calling procedure is responsible fo r handling the error, and so \\nwe do not specify what action to take. \\nExercises \\n2.1-1 \\nUsing Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operati on of I NSERTION -SORT on an \\narray initially containing the sequence h31;41;59;26;41;58 i. \\n2.1-2 \\nConsider the procedure S UM-ARRAY on the facing page.

There might be more than just one viable \\ncandidate, but you can often rule out several inferior algorithms in the process. \\nBefore you can analyze an algorithm, you need a mod el of the technology that \\nit runs on, including the resources of that technol ogy and a way to express their \\ncosts. Most of this book assumes a generic one-processor, random-access ma- \\nchine (RAM) model of computation as the implementation technolo gy, with the \\nunderstanding that algorithms are implemented as computer programs. In the RAM \\nmodel, instructions execute one after another, with no concurrent operations. The \\nRAM model assumes that each instruction takes the s ame amount of time as any \\nother instruction and that each data access4using the value of a variable or storing \\ninto a variable4takes the same amount of time as any other data access. In other \\nwords, in the RAM model each instruction or data access takes a constant amount \\nof time4even indexing into an array. 9 \\nStrictly speaking, we should precisely deûne the instructions of the RAM model \\nand their costs. To do so, however, would be tedious and yield little insight into al- \\ngorithm design and analysis. Yet we must be careful not to abuse the RAM model. \\nFor example, what if a RAM had an instruction that sorts? Then you could sort \\nin just one step. Such a RAM would be unrealistic, since such instructions do \\nnot appear in real computers. Our guide, therefore, is how real computers are de- \\nsigned. The RAM model contains instructions commonly found in real computers: \\narithmetic (such as add, subtract, multiply, divide , remainder, üoor, ceiling), data \\nmovement (load, store, copy), and control (conditio nal and unconditional branch, \\nsubroutine call and return). \\nThe data types in the RAM model are integer, üoating point (for storing real- \\nnumber approximations), and character. Real compute rs do not usually have a \\nseparate data type for the boolean values TRUE and FALSE . Instead, they often test \\nwhether an integer value is 0 (FALSE ) or nonzero ( TRUE ), as in C. Although we \\ntypically do not concern ourselves with precision for üoating-point values in this \\nbook (many numbers cannot be represented exactly in üoating point), precision is \\ncrucial for most applications. We also assume that each word of data has a limit on \\nthe number of bits. For example, when working with inputs of size n, we typically \\n9 We assume that each element of a given array occupi es the same number of bytes and that the \\nelements of a given array are stored in contiguous memory locations. For example, if array AŒ1 W n� \\nstarts at memory address 1000 and each element occupies four bytes, then element AŒi� is at address \\n1000 C 4.i \\ue003 1/. In general, computing the address in memory of a particular array element requires \\nat most one subtraction (no subtraction for a 0-origin array), one multiplication (often implemented \\nas a shift operation if the element size is an exac t power of 2), and one addition. Furthermore, for \\ncode that iterates through the elements of an array in order, an optimizing compiler can generate the \\naddress of each element using just one addition, by  adding the element size to the address of the \\npreceding element.

We \\nrequire c \\ue004 1 so that each word can hold the value of n, enabling us to index \\nthe individual input elements, and we restrict c to be a constant so that the word \\nsize does not grow arbitrarily. (If the word size c ould grow arbitrarily, we could \\nstore huge amounts of data in one word and operate on it all in c onstant time4an \\nunrealistic scenario.) \\nReal computers contain instructions not listed above, and such instructions rep- \\nresent a gray area in the RAM model. For example, i s exponentiation a constant- \\ntime instruction? In the general case, no: to compute x n when x and n are general \\nintegers typically takes time logarithmic in n (see equation (31.34) on page 934), \\nand you must worry about whether the result ûts into a computer word. If n is an \\nexact power of 2, however, exponentiation can usually be viewed as a constant-time \\noperation. Many computers have a <shift left= instr uction, which in constant time \\nshifts the bits of an integer by n positions to the left. In most computers, shifting \\nthe bits of an integer by 1 position to the left is equivalent to multiplying b y 2, so \\nthat shifting the bits by n positions to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 n . \\nTherefore, such computers can compute 2 n in 1 constant-time instruction by shift- \\ning the integer 1 by n positions to the left, as long as n is no more than the number \\nof bits in a computer word. We’ll try to avoid such gray areas in the RAM model \\nand treat computing 2 n and multiplying by 2 n as constant-time operations when \\nthe result is small enough to ût in a computer word. \\nThe RAM model does not account for the memory hiera rchy that is common \\nin contemporary computers. It models neither caches  nor vir tual memory. Sev- \\neral other computational models attempt to account for memory-hierarchy effects, \\nwhich are sometimes signiûcant in real programs on real machines. Section 11.5 \\nand a handful of problems in this book examine memory-hierarchy effects, but for \\nthe most part, the analyses in this book do not consider them. Models that include \\nthe memory hierarchy are quite a bit more complex t han the RAM model, and so \\nthey can be difûcult to work with. Moreover, RAM-model analyses are usually \\nexcellent predictors of performance on actual machines. \\nAlthough it is often straightforward to analyze an algorithm in the RAM model, \\nsometimes it can be quite a challenge. You might ne ed to employ mathematical \\ntools such as combinatorics, probability theory, algebraic dexterity, and the ability \\nto identify the most signiûcant terms in a formula. Because an algorithm might \\nbehave differently for each possible input, we need a means for summarizing that \\nbehavior in simple, easily understood formulas. \\nAnalysis of insertion sort \\nHow long does the I NSERTION -SORT procedure take?

What would such a timing test tell you? You would ûnd out \\nhow long insertion sort takes to run on your particular computer, on that particular \\ninput, under the particular implementation that you  created, with the particular \\ncompiler or interpreter that you ran, with the part icular libraries that you linked \\nin, and with the particular background tasks that w ere running on your computer \\nconcurrently with your timing test (such as checking for incoming information over \\na network). If you run insertion sort again on your  computer with the same input, \\nyou might even get a different timing result. From running just one implementation \\nof insertion sort on just one computer and on just one input, what would you be able \\nto determine about insertion sort’s running time if you were to give it a different \\ninput, if you were to run it on a different computer, or if you were to implement it \\nin a different programming language? Not much. We need a way to predict, given \\na new input, how long insertion sort will take. \\nInstead of timing a run, or even several runs, of insertion sort, we can determine \\nhow long it takes by analyzing the algorithm itself. We’ll examine how many times \\nit executes each line of pseudocode and how long ea ch line of pseudocode takes \\nto run. We’ll ûrst come up with a precise but complicated formula for the running \\ntime. Then, we’ll distill the important part of the formula using a convenient no- \\ntation that can help us compare the running times o f different algorithms for the \\nsame problem. \\nHow do we analyze insertion sort? First, let’s acknowledge that the running time \\ndepends on the input. You shouldn’t be terribly surprised that sorting a thousand \\nnumbers takes longer than sorting three numbers. Moreover, insertion sort can take \\ndifferent amounts of time to sort two input arrays of the same size, depending on \\nhow nearly sorted they already are. Even though the  running time can depend on \\nmany features of the input, we’ll focus on the one that has been shown to have \\nthe greatest effect, namely the size of the input, and describe the running time of a \\nprogram as a function of the size of its input. To do so, we need to deûne the terms \\n<running time= and <input size= more carefully. We also need to be clear about \\nwhether we are discussing the running time for an input that elicits the worst-case \\nbehavior, the best-case behavior, or some other case. \\nThe best notion for input size depends on the problem being studied. For many \\nproblems, such as sorting or computing discrete Fou rier transforms, the most nat- \\nural measure is the number of items in the input4for example, the number n of \\nitems being sorted. For many other problems, such a s multiplying two integers, \\nthe best measure of input size is the total number of bits needed to represent the \\ninput in ordinary binary notation. Sometimes it is more appropriate to describe the \\nsize of the input with more than just one number. F or example, if the input to an \\nalgorithm is a graph, we usually characterize the i nput size by both the number '),\n",

We’ll indicate which input size \\nmeasure is being used with each problem we study. \\nThe running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of in- \\nstructions and data accesses executed. How we accou nt for these costs should be \\nindependent of any particular computer, but within the framework of the RAM \\nmodel. For the moment, let us adopt the following v iew. A constant amount of \\ntime is required to execute each line of our pseudocode. One line might take more \\nor less time than another line, but we’ll assume that each execution of the kth line \\ntakes c k time, where c k is a constant. This viewpoint is in keeping with th e RAM \\nmodel, and it also reüects how the pseudocode would be implemented on most \\nactual computers. 10 \\nLet’s analyze the I NSERTION -SORT procedure. As promised, we’ll start by de- \\nvising a precise formula that uses the input size a nd all the statement costs c k . \\nThis formula turns out to be messy, however. We’ll then switch to a simpler no- \\ntation that is more concise and easier to use. This  simpler notation makes clear \\nhow to compare the running times of algorithms, especially as the size of the input \\nincreases. \\nTo analyze the I NSERTION -SORT procedure, let’s view it on the following page \\nwith the time cost of each statement and the number  of times each statement is \\nexecuted. For each i D 2;3;:::;n , let t i denote the number of times the while \\nloop test in line 5 is executed for that value of i . When a for or while loop exits \\nin the usual way4because the test in the loop header comes up FALSE 4the test is \\nexecuted one time more than the loop body. Because comments are not executable \\nstatements, assume that they take no time. \\nThe running time of the algorithm is the sum of run ning times f or each state- \\nment executed. A statement that takes c k steps to execute and executes m times \\ncontributes c k m to the total running time. 11 We usually denote the running time of \\nan algorithm on an input of size n by T.n/. To compute T.n/, the running time \\nof I NSERTION -SORT on an input of n values, we sum the products of the cost and \\ntimes columns, obtaining \\n10 There are some subtleties here. Computational steps that we specify in English are often variants \\nof a procedure that requires more than just a const ant amount of time. For example, in the R ADIX - \\nSORT procedure on page 213, one line reads <use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i ,= which, \\nas we shall see, takes more than a constant amount of time. Also, although a statement that calls a \\nsubroutine takes only constant time, the subroutine itself, once invoked, may take more. That is, we \\nseparate the process of calling the subroutine4passing parameters to it, etc.4from the process of \\nexecuting the subroutine. \\n11 This characteristic does not necessarily hold for a  resource such as memory. A statement that \\nreferences m words of memory and is executed n times does not necessarily reference mn distinct \\nwords of memory. '),\n",

Why? Here are three reasons: \\n\\ue001 The worst-case running time of an algorithm gives an upper bound on the run- \\nning time for any input. If you know it, then you have a guarantee th at the \\nalgorithm never takes any longer. You need not make  some educated guess \\nabout the running time and hope that it never gets much worse. This feature is \\nespecially important for real-time computing, in which operations must com- \\nplete by a deadline. \\n\\ue001 For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often. For example, in search- \\ning a database for a particular piece of informatio n, the sea rching algorithm’s \\nworst case often occurs when the information is not present in the database. In \\nsome applications, searches for absent information may be frequent. '),\n",

Suppose that \\nyou run insertion sort on an array of n randomly chosen numbers. How long \\ndoes it take to determine where in subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1� to insert element AŒi�? \\nOn average, half the elements in AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1� are less than AŒi�, and half the \\nelements are greater. On average, therefore, AŒi� is compared with just half \\nof the subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1�, and so t i is about i=2. The resulting average-case \\nrunning time turns out to be a quadratic function o f the input size, just like the \\nworst-case running time. \\nIn some particular cases, we’ll be interested in the average-case running time of \\nan algorithm. We’ll see the technique of probabilistic analysis applied to various \\nalgorithms throughout this book. The scope of average-case analysis is limited, \\nbecause it may not be apparent what constitutes an <average= input for a particular \\nproblem. Often, we’ll assume that all inputs of a given size are equally likely. In \\npractice, this assumption may be violated, but we can sometimes use a randomized \\nalgorithm, which makes random choices, to allow a probabilistic analysis and yield \\nan expected running time. We explore randomized algorithms more  in Chap ter 5 \\nand in several other subsequent chapters. \\nOrder of growth \\nIn order to ease our analysis of the I NSERTION -SORT procedure, we used some \\nsimplifying abstractions. First, we ignored the actual cost of each statement, using \\nthe constants c k to represent these costs. Still, the best-case and worst-case run- \\nning times in equations (2.1) and (2.2) are rather unwieldy. The constants in these \\nexpressions give us more detail than we really need. That’s why we also expressed \\nthe best-case running time as an C b for constants a and b that depend on the state- \\nment costs c k and why we expressed the worst-case running time as an 2 C bn C c \\nfor constants a, b, and c that depend on the statement costs. We thus ignored  not \\nonly the actual statement costs, but also the abstract costs c k . \\nLet’s now make one more simplifying abstraction: it is the \\nrate of growth, or \\norder of growth, of the running time that really interests us. We therefore consider \\nonly the leading term of a formula (e.g., an 2 ), since the lower-order terms are rela- \\ntively insigniûcant for large values of n. We also ignore the leading term’s constant \\ncoefûcient, since constant factors are less signiûcant than the rate of growth in de- \\ntermining computational efûciency for large inputs. For insertion sort’s worst-case \\nrunning time, when we ignore the lower-order terms and the leading term’s con- \\nstant coefûcient, only the factor of n 2 from the leading term remains.

Although 10,000 might seem large, it \\nis smaller than the population of an average town. Many real-world problems have \\nmuch larger input sizes. \\nTo highlight the order of growth of the running time, we have a special notation \\nthat uses the Greek letter ‚ (theta). We write that insertion sort has a worst-case \\nrunning time of ‚.n 2 / (pronounced <theta of n-squared= or just <theta n-squared=). \\nWe also write that insertion sort has a best-case running time of ‚.n/ (<theta of n= \\nor <theta n=). For now, think of ‚-notation as saying <roughly proportional when \\nn is large,= so that ‚.n 2 / means <roughly proportional to n 2 when n is large= and \\n‚.n/ means <roughly proportional to n when n is large= We’ll use ‚-notation \\ninformally in this chapter and deûne it precisely in Chapter 3. \\nWe usually consider one algorithm to be more efûcient than another if its worst- \\ncase running time has a lower order of growth. Due to constant factors and lower- \\norder terms, an algorithm whose running time has a higher order of growth might \\ntake less time for small inputs than an algorithm whose running time has a lower or- \\nder of growth. But on large enough inputs, an algorithm whose worst-case running \\ntime is ‚.n 2 /, for example, takes less time in the worst case th an an algorithm \\nwhose worst-case running time is ‚.n 3 /. Regardless of the constants hidden by \\nthe ‚-notation, there is always some number, say n 0 , such that for all input sizes \\nn \\ue004 n 0 , the ‚.n 2 / algorithm beats the ‚.n 3 / algorithm in the worst case. \\nExercises \\n2.2-1 \\nExpress the function n 3 =1000 C 100n 2 \\ue003 100n C 3 in terms of ‚-notation. \\n2.2-2 \\nConsider sorting n numbers stored in array AŒ1 W n� by ûrst ûnding the smallest \\nelement of AŒ1 W n� and exchanging it with the element in AŒ1�.

Justify your answers. \\n2.2-4 \\nHow can you modify any sorting algorithm to have a good best-case running time? \\n2.3 Designing algorithms \\nYou can choose from a wide range of algorithm desig n techniques. Insertion sort \\nuses the incremental method: for each element AŒi�, insert it into its proper place \\nin the subarray AŒ1 W i�, having already sorted the subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1�. \\nThis section examines another design method, known as <divide-and-conquer,= \\nwhich we explore in more detail in Chapter 4. We’ll use divide-and-conquer to \\ndesign a sorting algorithm whose worst-case running time is much less than that \\nof insertion sort. One advantage of using an algorithm that follows the divide-and- \\nconquer method is that analyzing its running time i s often straightforward, using \\ntechniques that we’ll explore in Chapter 4. \\n2.3.1 The divide-and-conquer method \\nMany useful algorithms are recursive in structure: to solve a given problem, they \\nrecurse (call themselves) one or more times to handle close ly relate d subprob- \\nlems. These algorithms typically follow the divide-and-conquer method: they \\nbreak the problem into several subproblems that are  similar to the original prob- \\nlem but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these \\nsolutions to create a solution to the original problem. \\nIn the divide-and-conquer method, if the problem is small enough4the base \\ncase4you just solve it directly without recursing. Otherwise4the recursive case \\n4you perform three characteristic steps: \\nDivide the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the \\nsame problem. \\nConquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. \\nCombine the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem. \\nThe merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer method. In \\neach step, it sorts a subarray AŒp W r�, starting with the entire array AŒ1 W n� and \\nrecursing down to smaller and smaller subarrays. Here is how merge sort operates: '),\n",

To do so, compute the midpoint q of AŒp W r� (taking the average of p \\nand r ), and divide AŒp W r� into subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r�. \\nConquer by sorting each of the two subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� recursively \\nusing merge sort. \\nCombine by merging the two sorted subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� back into \\nAŒp W r�, producing the sorted answer. \\nThe recursion <bottoms out=4it reaches the base case4when the subarray AŒp W r� \\nto be sorted has just 1 element, that is, when p equals r . As we noted in the ini- \\ntialization argument for I NSERTION -SORT’s loop invariant, a subarray comprising \\njust a single element is always sorted. \\nThe key operation of the merge sort algorithm occur s in the <combine= step, \\nwhich merges two adjacent, sorted subarrays. The me rge operation is performed \\nby the auxiliary procedure M ERGE.A;p;q;r/  on the following page, where A is \\nan array and p, q, and r are indices into the array such that p හ q < r . The \\nprocedure assumes that the adjacent subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� were al- \\nready recursively sorted. It \\nmerges the two sorted subarrays to form a single sorted \\nsubarray that replaces the current subarray AŒp W r�. \\nTo understand how the MERGE procedure works, let’s return to our card-playing \\nmotif. Suppose that you have two piles of cards fac e up on a table. Each pile is \\nsorted, with the smallest-value cards on top. You wish to merge the two piles \\ninto a single sorted output pile, which is to be fa ce down on the table. The basic \\nstep consists of choosing the smaller of the two ca rds on top o f the face-up piles, \\nremoving it from its pile4which exposes a new top card4and placing this card \\nface down onto the output pile. Repeat this step un til one input pile is empty, at \\nwhich time you can just take the remaining input pile and üip over the entire pile, \\nplacing it face down onto the output pile. \\nLet’s think about how long it takes to merge two sorted piles of cards. Each basic \\nstep takes constant time, since you are comparing just the two top cards. If the two \\nsorted piles that you start with each have n=2 cards, then the number of basic steps \\nis at least n=2 (since in whichever pile was emptied, every card wa s found to be \\nsmaller than some card from the other pile) and at most n (actually, at most n \\ue003 1, \\nsince after n \\ue003 1 basic steps, one of the piles must be empty). With each basic step \\ntaking constant time and the total number of basic steps being between n=2 and n, \\nwe can say that merging takes time roughly proporti onal to n. That is, merging \\ntakes ‚.n/ time. \\nIn detail, the M ERGE procedure works as follows. It copies the two subar rays \\nAŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� into temporary arrays L and R (<left= and <right=), and \\nthen it merges the values in L and R back into AŒp W r�. Lines 1 and 2 compute the \\nlengths n L and n R of the subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r�, respectively. Then '),\n",

For merge sort, both a and b are 2, but we’ll see other divide-and-conquer \\nalgorithms in which a ¤ b. It takes T.n=b/ time to solve one subproblem of \\nsize n=b, and so it takes aT.n=b/ time to solve all a of them. If it takes D.n/ time \\nto divide the problem into subproblems and C.n/ time to combine the solutions to \\nthe subproblems into the solution to the original problem, we get the recurrence \\n16 If you’re wondering where ‚.1/ comes from, think of it this way.

The c 2 n term denotes the cost of dividing and com- \\nbining at the top level of recursion, and the two s ubtrees of the root are the two \\nsmaller recurrences T.n=2/. Part (c) shows this process carried one step further by \\nexpanding T.n=2/. The cost for dividing and combining at each of th e two nodes \\nat the second level of recursion is c 2 n=2. Continue to expand each node in the tree \\nby breaking it into its constituent parts as determ ined by the recurrence, until the \\nproblem sizes get down to 1, each with a cost of c 1 . Part (d) shows the resulting \\nrecursion tree. \\nNext, add the costs across each level of the tree. The top level has total cost c 2 n, \\nthe next level down has total cost c 2 .n=2/ C c 2 .n=2/ D c 2 n, the level after that has \\ntotal cost c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ D c 2 n, and so on. Each level \\nhas twice as many nodes as the level above, but eac h node contributes only half \\nthe cost of a node from the level above. From one l evel to the next, doubling and \\nhalving cancel each other out, so that the cost across each level is the same: c 2 n. In \\ngeneral, the level that is i levels below the top has 2 i nodes, each contributing a cost \\nof c 2 .n=2 i /, so that the i th level below the top has total cost 2 i \\ue001 c 2 .n=2 i / D c 2 n. \\nThe bottom level has n nodes, each contributing a cost of c 1 , for a total cost of c 1 n. \\nThe total number of levels of the recursion tree in Figure 2.5 is lg n C 1, where \\nn is the number of leaves, corresponding to the input  size. An informal inductive \\nargument justiûes this claim. The base case occurs when n D 1, in which case \\nthe tree has only 1 level. Since lg 1 D 0, we have that lg n C 1 gives the correct \\nnumber of levels. Now assume as an inductive hypothesis that the number of levels \\nof a recursion tree with 2 i leaves is lg 2 i C 1 D i C 1 (since for any value of i , we \\nhave that lg 2 i D i ). Because we assume that the input size is an exact power of 2, \\nthe next input size to consider is 2 i C1 .

The ûrst volume ushered in the modern \\nstudy of computer algorithms with a focus on the an alysis of running time. The \\nfull series remains an engaging and worthwhile refe rence for many of the topics \\npresented here. According to Knuth, the word <algorithm= is derived from the \\nname <al-Khowˆ arizmˆ ı,= a ninth-century Persian mathematician. \\nAho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] advocated the asymptotic analysis of algorithms \\n4using notations that Chapter 3 introduces, including ‚-notation4as a means \\nof comparing relative performance. They also popula rized the use of recurrence \\nrelations to describe the running times of recursive algorithms. \\nKnuth [261] provides an encyclopedic treatment of many sorting algorithms. His \\ncomparison of sorting algorithms (page 381) includes exact step-counting analyses, \\nlike the one we performed here for insertion sort. Knuth’s discussion of insertion \\nsort encompasses several variations of the algorithm. The most important of these \\nis Shell’s sort, introduced by D. L. Shell, which uses insertion sort on periodic \\nsubarrays of the input to produce a faster sorting algorithm. \\nMerge sort is also described by Knuth.

Although we can sometimes determine \\nthe exact running time of an algorithm, as we did f or insertion sort in Chapter 2, \\nthe extra precision is rarely worth the effort of c omputing it. For large enough \\ninputs, the multiplicative constants and lower-order terms of an exact running time \\nare dominated by the effects of the input size itself. \\nWhen we look at input sizes large enough to make re levant only the order of \\ngrowth of the running time, we are studying the asymptotic efûciency of algo- \\nrithms.

Consequently, the function g.n/ itself must be asymptotically \\nnonnegative, or else the set O.g.n// is empty. We therefore assume that every \\nfunction used within O-notation is asymptotically nonnegative. This assumption \\nholds for the other asymptotic notations deûned in this chapter as well. \\nYou might be surprised that we deûne O-notation in terms of sets. Indeed, you \\nmight expect that we would write < f.n/ 2 O.g.n//= to indicate that f.n/ be- \\nlongs to the set O.g.n//. Instead, we usually write < f.n/ D O.g.n//= and say \\n<f.n/ is big-oh of g.n/= to express the same notion. Although it may seem con- \\nfusing at ûrst to abuse equality in this way, we’ll see later in this section that doing \\nso has its advantages. \\nLet’s explore an example of how to use the formal deûnition of O-notation to \\njustify our practice of discarding lower-order terms and ignoring the constant coef- \\nûcient of the highest-order term. We’ll show that 4n 2 C100n C500 D O.n 2 /, even \\nthough the lower-order terms have much larger coefûcients than the leading term. \\nWe need to ûnd positive constants c and n 0 such that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 හ cn 2 \\nfor all n \\ue004 n 0 . Dividing both sides by n 2 gives 4 C 100=n C 500=n 2 හ c . This \\ninequality is satisûed for many choices of c and n 0 . For example, if we choose \\nn 0 D 1, then this inequality holds for c D 604. If we choose n 0 D 10, then c D 19 \\nworks, and choosing n 0 D 100 allows us to use c D 5:05. \\nWe can also use the formal deûnition of O-notation to show that the function \\nn 3 \\ue003 100n 2 does not belong to the set O.n 2 /, even though the coefûcient of n 2 \\nis a large negative number.

In \\nother words, for all n \\ue004 n 0 , the function f.n/ is equal to g.n/ to within constant \\nfactors. \\nThe deûnitions of O-, �-, and ‚-notations lead to the following theorem, whose \\nproof we leave as Exercise 3.2-4. \\nTheorem 3.1 \\nFor any two functions f.n/ and g.n/, we have f.n/ D ‚.g.n// if and only if \\nf.n/ D O.g.n// and f.n/ D �.g.n//. \\nWe typically apply Theorem 3.1 to prove asymptotically tight bounds from asymp- \\ntotic upper and lower bounds. \\nAsymptotic notation and running times \\nWhen you use asymptotic notation to characterize an  algorit hm’s running time, \\nmake sure that the asymptotic notation you use is a s precise as possible without \\noverstating which running time it applies to. Here are some examples of using \\nasymptotic notation properly and improperly to characterize running times. \\nLet’s start with insertion sort.

We can also correctly say \\nthat insertion sort’s best-case running time is O.n/, �.n/, and ‚.n/, again with \\n‚.n/ the most precise and therefore the most preferred. \\nHere is what we cannot correctly say: insertion sort’s running time is ‚.n 2 /. \\nThat is an overstatement because by omitting <worst-case= from the statement, \\nwe’re left with a blanket statement covering all cases. The error here is that inser- \\ntion sort does not run in ‚.n 2 / time in all cases since, as we’ve seen, it runs in \\n‚.n/ time in the best case. We can correctly say that insertion sort’s running time \\nis O.n 2 /, however, because in all cases, its running time g rows no faster than n 2 . \\nWhen we say O.n 2 / instead of ‚.n 2 /, there is no problem in having cases whose \\nrunning time grows more slowly than n 2 . Likewise, we cannot correctly say that \\ninsertion sort’s running time is ‚.n/, but we can say that its running time is �.n/. \\nHow about merge sort? Since merge sort runs in ‚.n lg n/ time in all cases, \\nwe can just say that its running time is ‚.n lg n/ without specifying worst-case, \\nbest-case, or any other case. \\nPeople occasionally conüate O-notation with ‚-notation by mistakenly using \\nO-notation to indicate an asymptotically tight bound. They say things like <an \\nO.n lg n/-time algorithm runs faster than an O.n 2 /-time algorithm.= Maybe it \\ndoes, maybe it doesn’t. Since O-notation denotes only an asymptotic upper bound, \\nthat so-called O.n 2 /-time algorithm might actually run in ‚.n/ time. You should \\nbe careful to choose the appropriate asymptotic not ation. If you want to indicate \\nan asymptotically tight bound, use ‚-notation. \\nWe typically use asymptotic notation to provide the  simplest and most precise \\nbounds possible. For example, if an algorithm has a  running time of 3n 2 C 20n \\nin all cases, we use asymptotic notation to write t hat its running time is ‚.n 2 /. \\nStrictly speaking, we are also correct in writing t hat the running time is O.n 3 / or \\n‚.3n 2 C 20n/. Neither of these expressions is as useful as writ ing ‚.n 2 / in this \\ncase, however: O.n 3 / is less precise than ‚.n 2 / if the running time is 3n 2 C 20n, \\nand ‚.3n 2 C 20n/ introduces complexity that obscures the order of gr owth. By \\nwriting the simplest and most precise bound, such a s ‚.n 2 /, we can categorize \\nand compare different algorithms. Throughout the bo ok, you will see asymptotic \\nrunning times that are almost always based on polynomials and logarithms: func- \\ntions such as n, n lg 2 n, n 2 lg n, or n 1=2 . You will also see some other functions, \\nsuch as exponentials, lg lg n, and lg \\ue003 n (see Section 3.3). It is usually fairly easy \\nto compare the rates of growth of these functions. Problem 3-3 gives you good \\npractice. '),\n",

For example, we \\nwrote that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D O.n 2 /. We might also write 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D \\n2n 2 C ‚.n/. How do we interpret such formulas? \\nWhen the asymptotic notation stands alone (that is, not within a larger formula) \\non the right-hand side of an equation (or inequality), as in 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D \\nO.n 2 /, the equal sign means set membership: 4n 2 C 100n C 500 2 O.n 2 /. In \\ngeneral, however, when asymptotic notation appears in a formula, we interpret it as \\nstanding for some anonymous function that we do not care to name. For example, \\nthe formula 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C ‚.n/ means that 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C f.n/, \\nwhere f.n/ 2 ‚.n/. In this case, we let f.n/ D 3n C 1, which indeed belongs \\nto ‚.n/. \\nUsing asymptotic notation in this manner can help e liminate inessential detail \\nand clutter in an equation. For example, in Chapter 2 we expressed the worst-case \\nrunning time of merge sort as the recurrence \\nT.n/ D 2T.n=2/ C ‚.n/: \\nIf we are interested only in the asymptotic behavio r of T.n/, there is no point in \\nspecifying all the lower-order terms exactly, because they are all understood to be \\nincluded in the anonymous function denoted by the term ‚.n/. \\nThe number of anonymous functions in an expression is understood to be equal \\nto the number of times the asymptotic notation appe ars. For e xample, in the ex- \\npression \\nn X \\ni D1 \\nO.i/;  \\nthere is only a single anonymous function (a function of i ). This expression is thus \\nnot the same as O.1/ C O.2/ C \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 C O.n/, which doesn’t really have a clean \\ninterpretation. \\nIn some cases, asymptotic notation appears on the left-hand side of an equation, \\nas in \\n2n 2 C ‚.n/ D ‚.n 2 /: \\nInterpret such equations using the following rule: No matter how the anonymous \\nfunctions are chosen on the left of the equal sign, there is a way to choose the \\nanonymous functions on the right of the equal sign to make the equation valid. \\nThus, our example means that for any function f.n/ 2 ‚.n/, there is some function \\ng.n/ 2 ‚.n 2 / such that 2n 2 Cf.n/ D g.n/ for all n. In other words, the right-hand \\nside of an equation provides a coarser level of detail than the left-hand side. '),\n",

The ûrst equation says that \\nthere is some function f.n/ 2 ‚.n/ such that 2n 2 C3n C1 D 2n 2 C f.n/ for all n. \\nThe second equation says that for any function g.n/ 2 ‚.n/ (such as the f.n/ just \\nmentioned), there is some function h.n/ 2 ‚.n 2 / such that 2n 2 C g.n/ D h.n/ for \\nall n. This interpretation implies that 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D ‚.n 2 /, which is what the \\nchaining of equations intuitively says. \\nProper abuses of asymptotic notation \\nBesides the abuse of equality to mean set membershi p, which we now see has a \\nprecise mathematical interpretation, another abuse of asymptotic notation occurs \\nwhen the variable tending toward 1 must be inferred from context. For example, \\nwhen we say O.g.n//, we can assume that we’re interested in the growth of g.n/ \\nas n grows, and if we say O.g.m// we’re talking about the growth of g.m/ as m \\ngrows. The free variable in the expression indicates what variable is going to 1. \\nThe most common situation requiring contextual know ledge of which variable \\ntends to 1 occurs when the function inside the asymptotic nota tion is a constant, \\nas in the expression O.1/. We cannot infer from the expression which variabl e is \\ngoing to 1, because no variable appears there. The context must disambiguate. For \\nexample, if the equation using asymptotic notation is f.n/ D O.1/, it’s apparent \\nthat the variable we’re interested in is n. Knowing from context that the variable of \\ninterest is n, however, allows us to make perfect sense of the e xpression by using \\nthe formal deûnition of O-notation: the expression f.n/ D O.1/ means that the \\nfunction f.n/ is bounded from above by a constant as n goes to 1. Technically, it \\nmight be less ambiguous if we explicitly indicated the variable tending to 1 in the \\nasymptotic notation itself, but that would clutter the notation. Instead, we simply \\nensure that the context makes it clear which variable (or variables) tend to 1. \\nWhen the function inside the asymptotic notation is bounded by a positive con- \\nstant, as in T.n/ D O.1/, we often abuse asymptotic notation in yet another  way, \\nespecially when stating recurrences. We may write s omething like T.n/ D O.1/ \\nfor n < 3. According to the formal deûnition of O-notation, this statement is \\nmeaningless, because the deûnition only says that T.n/ is bounded above by a \\npositive constant c for n \\ue004 n 0 for some n 0 > 0. The value of T.n/ for n < n 0 \\nneed not be so bounded. Thus, in the example T.n/ D O.1/ for n<3 , we cannot \\ninfer any constraint on T.n/ when n<3 , because it might be that n 0 >3. \\nWhat is conventionally meant when we say T.n/ D O.1/ for n<3  is that there \\nexists a positive constant c such that T.n/ හ c for n<3 .

Similar abuses occur \\nwith the other asymptotic notations.

The recursion \\nbottoms out when it reaches a base case and the sub- \\nproblem is small enough to solve directly without further recursing. \\nRecurrences \\nTo analyze recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms, we’ll need some mathemat- \\nical tools. A recurrence is an equation that describes a function in terms o f its \\nvalue on other, typically smaller, arguments.

To understand why these two divide-and-conquer algorithms perform the \\nway they do, you’ll need to learn how to solve the recurrences that describe their \\nrunning times. Sections 4.334.7 teach several methods for solving recurrences. \\nThese sections also explore the mathematics behind recurrences, which can give \\nyou stronger intuition for designing your own divide-and-conquer algorithms. \\nWe want to get to the algorithms as soon as possible. So, let’s just cover a few \\nrecurrence basics now, and then we’ll look more deeply at recurrences, especially \\nhow to solve them, after we see the matrix-multiplication examples. \\nThe general form of a recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a \\nfunction over the integers or reals using the function itself. It contains two or more \\ncases, depending on the argument. If a case involves the recursive invocation of the \\nfunction on different (usually smaller) inputs, it is a recursive case. If a case does \\nnot involve a recursive invocation, it is a base case. There may be zero, one, or \\nmany functions that satisfy the statement of the recurrence. The recurrence is well \\ndeﬁned if there is at least one function that satisûes it, and ill deﬁned otherwise. \\nAlgorithmic recurrences \\nWe’ll be particularly interested in recurrences that describe the running times of \\ndivide-and-conquer algorithms. A recurrence T.n/ is algorithmic if, for every \\nsufûciently large threshold constant n 0 >0, the following two properties hold: \\n1. For all n<n  0 , we have T.n/ D ‚.1/. \\n2. For all n \\ue004 n 0 , every path of recursion terminates in a deûned base case within \\na ûnite number of recursive invocations. \\nSimilar to how we sometimes abuse asymptotic notati on (see p age 60), when a \\nfunction is not deûned for all arguments, we understand that this deûnition is con- \\nstrained to values of n for which T.n/ is deûned. \\nWhy would a recurrence T.n/ that represents a (correct) divide-and-conquer al- \\ngorithm’s worst-case running time satisfy these properties for all sufûciently large \\nthreshold constants? The ûrst property says that there exist constants c 1 ;c 2 such \\nthat 0 < c 1 හ T.n/ හ c 2 for n < n 0 . For every legal input, the algorithm must \\noutput the solution to the problem it’s solving in ûnite time (see Section 1.1). Thus \\nwe can let c 1 be the minimum amount of time to call and return from a procedure, \\nwhich must be positive, because machine instruction s need t o be executed to in- \\nvoke a procedure. The running time of the algorithm may not be deûned for some \\nvalues of n if there are no legal inputs of that size, but it must be deûned for at \\nleast one, or else the <algorithm= doesn’t solve any problem. Thus we can let c 2 be \\nthe algorithm’s maximum running time on any input of size n < n 0 , where n 0 is '),\n",

Consequently, \\nT.n/ satisûes the ûrst property. If the second property fails to hold for T.n/, then \\nthe algorithm isn’t correct, because it would end up in an inûnite recursive loop or \\notherwise fail to compute a solution. Thus, it stands to reason that a recurrence for \\nthe worst-case running time of a correct divide-and-conquer algorithm would be \\nalgorithmic. \\nConventions for recurrences \\nWe adopt the following convention: \\nWhenever a recurrence is stated without an explicit base case, we assume \\nthat the recurrence is algorithmic. \\nThat means you’re free to pick any sufûciently large threshold constant n 0 for the \\nrange of base cases where T.n/ D ‚.1/. Interestingly, the asymptotic solutions of \\nmost algorithmic recurrences you’re likely to see when analyzing algorithms don’t \\ndepend on the choice of threshold constant, as long as it’s large enough to make \\nthe recurrence well deûned. \\nAsymptotic solutions of algorithmic divide-and-conquer recurrences also don’t \\ntend to change when we drop any üoors or ceilings in a recurrence deûned on the \\nintegers to convert it to a recurrence deûned on the reals. Section 4.7 gives a suf- \\nûcient condition for ignoring üoors and ceilings that applies to most of the divide- \\nand-conquer recurrences you’re likely to see. Consequently, we’ll frequently state \\nalgorithmic recurrences without üoors and ceilings. Doing so generally simpliûes \\nthe statement of the recurrences, as well as any math that we do with them. \\nYou may sometimes see recurrences that are not equa tions, but rather inequal- \\nities, such as T.n/ හ 2T.n=2/ C ‚.n/. Because such a recurrence states only \\nan upper bound on T.n/, we express its solution using O-notation rather than \\n‚-notation. Similarly, if the inequality is reversed to T.n/ \\ue004 2T.n=2/ C ‚.n/, \\nthen, because the recurrence gives only a lower bound on T.n/, we use �-notation \\nin its solution. \\nDivide-and-conquer and recurrences \\nThis chapter illustrates the divide-and-conquer method by presenting and using \\nrecurrences to analyze two divide-and-conquer algorithms for multiplying n \\ue005 n \\nmatrices. Section 4.1 presents a simple divide-and-conquer algorithm that solves \\na matrix-multiplication problem of size n by breaking it into four subproblems of \\nsize n=2, which it then solves recursively. The running tim e of the algorithm can \\nbe characterized by the recurrence '),\n",

Although it is common when using divide-and- \\nconquer for all the subproblems to have the same si ze, that is n’t always the case. \\nSometimes it’s productive to divide a problem of size n into subproblems of differ- \\nent sizes, and then the recurrence describing the running time reüects the irregular- \\nity. For example, consider a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides a problem \\nof size n into one subproblem of size n=3 and another of size 2n=3, taking ‚.n/ \\ntime to divide the problem and combine the solutions to the subproblems. Then the \\nalgorithm’s running time can be described by the recurrence \\nT .n/ D T .n=3/ C T .2n=3/ C ‚.n/ ; \\nwhich turns out to have solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. We’ll even see an algorithm in \\nChapter 9 that solves a problem of size n by recursively solving a subproblem of \\nsize n=5 and another of size 7n=10, taking ‚.n/ time for the divide and combine \\nsteps. Its performance satisûes the recurrence \\nT .n/ D T .n=5/ C T .7n=10/ C ‚.n/ ; \\nwhich has solution T .n/ D ‚.n/. \\nAlthough divide-and-conquer algorithms usually create subproblems with sizes \\na constant fraction of the original problem size, that’s not always the case.

But we also want general tools that work, pe rhaps with a little more effort, \\nfor less common cases. This chapter offers four methods for solving recurrences: \\n\\ue001 In the substitution method (Section 4.3), you guess the form of a bound and \\nthen use mathematical induction to prove your guess correct and solve for con- \\nstants. This method is perhaps the most robust method for solving recurrences, \\nbut it also requires you to make a good guess and to produce an inductive proof. \\n\\ue001 The recursion-tree method (Section 4.4) models the recurrence as a tree whose \\nnodes represent the costs incurred at various level s of the recursion. To solve \\nthe recurrence, you determine the costs at each level and add them up, perhaps \\nusing techniques for bounding summations from Section A.2. Even if you don’t \\nuse this method to formally prove a bound, it can be helpful in guessing the form \\nof the bound for use in the substitution method. \\n\\ue001 The master method (Sections 4.5 and 4.6) is the easiest method, when it applies. \\nIt provides bounds for recurrences of the form \\nT.n/ D aT.n=b/ C f.n/;  \\nwhere a >0 and b >1 are constants and f.n/ is a given <driving= function. \\nThis type of recurrence tends to arise more frequently in the study of algorithms \\nthan any other. It characterizes a divide-and-conquer algorithm that creates \\na subproblems, each of which is 1=b times the size of the original problem, \\nusing f.n/ time for the divide and combine steps. To apply the master method, \\nyou need to memorize three cases, but once you do, you can easily determine \\nasymptotic bounds on running times for many divide-and-conquer algorithms. \\n\\ue001 The \\nAkra-Bazzi method (Section 4.7) is a general method for solving divide- \\nand-conquer recurrences.

We’ll actually increase the work for each divide and combine step by a \\nconstant factor, but the reduction in bushiness wil l pay off . We won’t reduce the \\nbushiness from the eight-way branching of recurrence (4.9) all the way down to \\nthe two-way branching of recurrence (2.3), but we’ll improve it just a little, and \\nthat will make a big difference. Instead of perform ing eight recursive multiplica- \\ntions of n=2 \\ue005 n=2 matrices, Strassen’s algorithm performs only seven. The cost \\nof eliminating one matrix multiplication is several new additions and subtractions \\nof n=2 \\ue005 n=2 matrices, but still only a constant number.

The straightforward calculation requires two mult iplications to \\nsquare x and y , followed by one subtraction (which you can think of as a <negative \\naddition=). But let’s recall the old algebra trick x 2 \\ue003 y 2 D x 2 \\ue003 xy C xy \\ue003 y 2 D \\nx.x \\ue003 y/ C y.x \\ue003 y/ D .x C y/.x \\ue003 y/. Using this formulation of the desired \\nquantity, you could instead compute the sum x C y and the difference x \\ue003 y and \\nthen multiply them, requiring only a single multipl ication and two additions. At \\nthe cost of an extra addition, only one multiplicat ion is needed to compute an ex- \\npression that looks as if it requires two. If x and y are scalars, there’s not much \\ndifference: both approaches require three scalar op erations. If x and y are large \\nmatrices, however, the cost of multiplying outweighs the cost of adding, in which \\ncase the second method outperforms the ûrst, although not asymptotically. \\nStrassen’s strategy for reducing the number of matrix multiplications at the ex- \\npense of more matrix additions is not at all obvious4perhaps the biggest under- \\nstatement in this book! As with M ATRIX -MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE , Strassen’s al- \\ngorithm uses the divide-and-conquer method to compute C D C C A \\ue001 B , where \\nA, B , and C are all n \\ue005 n matrices and n is an exact power of 2. Strassen’s algo- \\nrithm computes the four submatrices C 11 , C 12 , C 21 , and C 22 of C from equations \\n(4.5)3(4.8) on page 82 in four steps. We’ll analyze costs as we go along to develop \\na recurrence T.n/ for the overall running time. Let’s see how it works: \\n1. If n D 1, the matrices each contain a single element. Perfo rm a single scalar \\nmultiplication and a single scalar addition, as in line 3 of MATRIX -MULTIPLY- \\nRECURSIVE , taking ‚.1/ time, and return. Otherwise, partition the input ma- \\ntrices A and B and output matrix C into n=2 \\ue005 n=2 submatrices, as in equa- \\ntion (4.2). This step takes ‚.1/ time by index calculation, just as in M ATRIX - \\nMULTIPLY-RECURSIVE . \\n2. Create n=2 \\ue005 n=2 matrices S 1 ;S 2 ;:::;S  10 , each of which is the sum or dif- \\nference of two submatrices from step 1. Create and zero the entries of seven \\nn=2 \\ue005 n=2 matrices P 1 ;P 2 ;:::;P  7 to hold seven n=2 \\ue005 n=2 matrix products. \\nAll 17 matrices can be created, and the P i initialized, in ‚.n 2 / time. \\n3. Using the submatrices from step 1 and the matrices S 1 ;S 2 ;:::;S  10 created in \\nstep 2, recursively compute each of the seven matri x products P 1 ;P 2 ;:::;P  7 , \\ntaking 7T.n=2/ time. \\n4. Update the four submatrices C 11 ;C 12 ;C 21 ;C 22 of the result matrix C by adding \\nor subtracting various P i matrices, which takes ‚.n 2 / time. '),\n",

Guess the form of the solution using symbolic constants. \\n2. Use mathematical induction to show that the solu tion works, and ûnd the con- \\nstants. \\nTo apply the inductive hypothesis, you substitute the guessed solution for the func- \\ntion on smaller values4hence the name <substitution method.= This method is \\npowerful, but you must guess the form of the answer. Although generating a good \\nguess might seem difûcult, a little practice can quickly improve your intuition. \\nYou can use the substitution method to establish either an upper or a lower bound \\non a recurrence. It’s usually best not to try to do both at the same time. That is, \\nrather than trying to prove a ‚-bound directly, ûrst prove an O-bound, and then \\nprove an �-bound. Together, they give you a ‚-bound (Theorem 3.1 on page 56). \\nAs an example of the substitution method, let’s determine an asymptotic upper \\nbound on the recurrence: \\nT.n/ D 2T.bn=2c/ C ‚.n/: (4.11) \\nThis recurrence is similar to recurrence (2.3) on page 41 for merge sort, except \\nfor the üoor function, which ensures that T.n/ is deûned over the integers.

As long as n 0 >1 (a \\nnew constraint on n 0 ), we have lg n > 0, which implies that n lg n > 0. So let’s \\npick n 0 D 2. Since the base case of recurrence (4.11) is not stated explicitly, by our \\nconvention, T.n/ is algorithmic, which means that T.2/ and T.3/ are constant (as \\nthey should be if they describe the worst-case running time of any real program on \\ninputs of size 2 or 3).

Then, it’s usually apparent, without spelling out \\nthe details, that with a suitably large choice of t he leading constant (such as c for \\nthis example), the inductive hypothesis can be made to hold for all the values in the \\nrange from n 0 to n 0 \\n0 .

Making a good guess takes experience and, \\noccasionally, creativity. Fortunately, learning som e recurrence-solving heuristics, \\nas well as playing around with recurrences to gain experience, can help you become \\na good guesser. You can also use recursion trees, which we’ll see in Section 4.4, to \\nhelp generate good guesses. \\nIf a recurrence is similar to one you’ve seen before, then guessing a similar \\nsolution is reasonable. As an example, consider the recurrence \\nT.n/ D 2T.n=2 C 17/ C ‚.n/; \\ndeûned on the reals. This recurrence looks somewhat like the merge-sort recur- \\nrence (2.3), but it’s more complicated because of the added <17= in the argument \\nto T on the right-hand side. Intuitively, however, this additional term shouldn’t \\nsubstantially affect the solution to the recurrence . When n is large, the relative \\ndifference between n=2 and n=2 C 17 is not that large: both cut n nearly in half. \\nConsequently, it makes sense to guess that T.n/ D O.n lg n/, which you can verify \\nis correct using the substitution method (see Exercise 4.3-1). \\nAnother way to make a good guess is to determine loose upper and lower bounds \\non the recurrence and then reduce your range of unc ertainty. For example, you \\nmight start with a lower bound of T.n/ D �.n/ for recurrence (4.11), since the \\nrecurrence includes the term ‚.n/, and you can prove an initial upper bound of \\nT.n/ D O.n 2 /. Then split your time between trying to lower the upper bound and \\ntrying to raise the lower bound until you converge on the correct, asymptotically \\ntight solution, which in this case is T.n/ D ‚.n lg n/. \\nA trick of the trade: subtracting a low-order term \\nSometimes, you might correctly guess a tight asympt otic bound on the solution \\nof a recurrence, but somehow the math fails to work  out in the induction proof. \\nThe problem frequently turns out to be that the inductive assumption is not strong \\nenough. The trick to resolving this problem is to r evise your guess by subtracting \\na lower-order term when you hit such a snag. The math then often goes through. \\nConsider the recurrence \\nT.n/ D 2T.n=2/ C ‚.1/ (4.12) \\ndeûned on the reals. Let’s guess that the solution is T.n/ D O.n/ and try to show \\nthat T.n/ හ cn for n \\ue004 n 0 , where we choose the constants c;n 0 > 0 suitably. \\nSubstituting our guess into the recurrence, we obtain \\nT.n/ හ 2.c.n=2// C ‚.1/ \\nD cn C ‚.1/; '),\n",

We might \\nbe tempted to try a larger guess, say T.n/ D O.n 2 /. Although this larger guess \\nworks, it provides only a loose upper bound. It turns out that our original guess of \\nT.n/ D O.n/ is correct and tight. In order to show that it is c orrect, however, we \\nmust strengthen our inductive hypothesis. \\nIntuitively, our guess is nearly right: we are off only by ‚.1/, a lower-order \\nterm. Nevertheless, mathematical induction requires us to prove the exact form of \\nthe inductive hypothesis.

Of course, we \\nmust not forget to handle the base case, which is t o choose the constant c large \\nenough that cn \\ue003 d dominates the implicit base cases. \\nYou might ûnd the idea of subtracting a lower-order term to be counterintuitive. \\nAfter all, if the math doesn’t work out, shouldn’t you increase your guess? Not \\nnecessarily! When the recurrence contains more than  one recursive invocation \\n(recurrence (4.12) contains two), if you add a lower-order term to the guess, then \\nyou end up adding it once for each of the recursive  invocations. Doing so takes \\nyou even further away from the inductive hypothesis. On the other hand, if you \\nsubtract a lower-order term from the guess, then you get to subtract it once for each \\nof the recursive invocations.

Drawing \\nout a recursion tree, as we did in our analysis of the merge-sort recurrence in Sec- \\ntion 2.3.2, can help. In a recursion tree, each node represents the cost of a single \\nsubproblem somewhere in the set of recursive function invocations. You typically \\nsum the costs within each level of the tree to obtain the per-level costs, and then you \\nsum all the per-level costs to determine the total cost of all levels of the recursion. \\nSometimes, however, adding up the total cost takes more creativity. \\nA recursion tree is best used to generate intuition  for a good guess, which you \\ncan then verify by the substitution method. If you are meticulous when drawing out \\na recursion tree and summing the costs, however, you can use a recursion tree as a \\ndirect proof of a solution to a recurrence. But if you use it only to generate a good \\nguess, you can often tolerate a small amount of <sl oppiness,= which can simplify \\nthe math. When you verify your guess with the subst itution method later on, your \\nmath should be precise. This section demonstrates how you can use recursion trees \\nto solve recurrences, generate good guesses, and gain intuition for recurrences. \\nAn illustrative example \\nLet’s see how a recursion tree can provide a good guess for an upper-bound solution \\nto the recurrence \\nT.n/ D 3T.n=4/ C ‚.n 2 /: (4.13) \\nFigure 4.1 shows how to derive the recursion tree for T.n/ D 3T.n=4/ C cn 2 , \\nwhere the constant c >0 is the upper-bound constant in the ‚.n 2 / term.

Part (c) shows this process carried one step furt her by \\nexpanding each node with cost T.n=4/ from part (b). The cost for each of the three \\nchildren of the root is c.n=4/ 2 . We continue expanding each node in the tree by \\nbreaking it into its constituent parts as determined by the recurrence. \\nBecause subproblem sizes decrease by a factor of 4 every time we go down one \\nlevel, the recursion must eventually bottom out in a base case where n <n 0 .

Thus, the tree has \\ninternal nodes at depths 0;1;2;:::;  log 4 n \\ue003 1 and leaves at depth log 4 n. \\nPart (d) of Figure 4.1 shows the cost at each level of the tree. Each level has \\nthree times as many nodes as the level above, and s o the number of nodes at \\ndepth i is 3 i . Because subproblem sizes reduce by a factor of 4 for each level \\nfurther from the root, each internal node at depth i D 0;1;2;:::;  log 4 n \\ue003 1 has a \\ncost of c.n=4 i / 2 .

Moreover, as we’ll see in Section 4.6, if you deûne your master recurrence \\non the reals, without implicit üoors and ceilings, the asymptotic bounds still don’t \\nchange.

Case 3 is the <opposite= of \\ncase 1, where the driving function grows asymptotically faster than the watershed \\nfunction. But the technical details matter. \\nIn case 1, not only must the watershed function grow asymptotically faster than \\nthe driving function, it must grow polynomially faster. That is, the watershed func- \\ntion n log b a must be asymptotically larger than the driving function f.n/ by at least \\na factor of ‚.n \\ue001 / for some constant �>0 . The master theorem then says that the \\nsolution is T.n/ D ‚.n log b a /. In this case, if we look at the recursion tree fo r the \\nrecurrence, the cost per level grows at least geometrically from root to leaves, and \\nthe total cost of leaves dominates the total cost of the internal nodes. \\nIn case 2, the watershed and driving functions grow  at nearly the same asymp- \\ntotic rate. But more speciûcally, the driving function grows faster than the wa- \\ntershed function by a factor of ‚.lg k n/, where k \\ue004 0. The master theorem \\nsays that we tack on an extra lg n factor to f.n/, yielding the solution T.n/ D \\n‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/.

If we look at the recursion tree, the \\ncost per level drops at least geometrically from the root to the leaves, and the root \\ncost dominates the cost of all other nodes. \\nIt’s worth looking again at the requirement that there be polynomial separation \\nbetween the watershed function and the driving function for either case 1 or case 3 \\nto apply. The separation doesn’t need to be much, but it must be there, and it must \\ngrow polynomially. For example, for the recurrence T.n/ D 4T.n=2/ C n 1:99 \\n(admittedly not a recurrence you’re likely to see when analyzing an algorithm), the \\nwatershed function is n log b a D n 2 . Hence the driving function f.n/ D n 1:99 is \\npolynomially smaller by a factor of n 0:01 . Thus case 1 applies with � D 0:01. \\nUsing the master method \\nTo use the master method, you determine which case (if any) of the master theorem \\napplies and write down the answer. \\nAs a ûrst example, consider the recurrence T.n/ D 9T.n=3/ C n.

The solution to the \\nrecurrence is T.n/ D ‚.lg n/. \\nFor the recurrence T.n/ D 3T.n=4/ C n lg n, we have a D 3 and b D 4, which \\nmeans that n log b a D n log 4 3 D O.n 0:793 /.

We might have that f.n/ \\ue007 n log b a for an inûnite number of values \\nof n but also that f.n/ \\ue008 n log b a for an inûnite number of different values of n. \\nAs a practical matter, however, most of the driving functions that arise in the study \\nof algorithms can be meaningfully compared with the  watershed function. If you \\nencounter a master recurrence for which that’s not the case, you’ll have to resort to \\nsubstitution or other methods. \\nEven when the relative growths of the driving and w atershed functions can be \\ncompared, the master theorem does not cover all the  possibilities. There is a gap \\nbetween cases 1 and 2 when f.n/ D o.n log b a /, yet the watershed function does \\nnot grow polynomially faster than the driving funct ion. Similarly, there is a gap \\nbetween cases 2 and 3 when f.n/ D !.n log b a / and the driving function grows \\nmore than polylogarithmically faster than the water shed function, but it does not \\ngrow polynomially faster. If the driving function falls into one of these gaps, or if \\nthe regularity condition in case 3 fails to hold, you’ll need to use something other \\nthan the master method to solve the recurrence. \\nAs an example of a driving function falling into a gap, consider the recurrence \\nT.n/ D 2T.n=2/ C n= lg n. Since a D 2 and b D 2, the watershed function \\nis n log b a D n log 2 2 D n 1 D n. The driving function is n= lg n D o.n/, which \\nmeans that it grows asymptotically more slowly than  the watershed function n. \\nBut n= lg n grows only logarithmically slower than n, not polynomially slower. \\nMore precisely, equation (3.24) on page 67 says that lg n D o.n \\ue001 / for any constant \\n�>0 , which means that 1= lg n D !.n \\ue002\\ue001 / and n= lg n D !.n 1\\ue002\\ue001 / D !.n log b a\\ue002\\ue001 /. \\nThus no constant � >0 exists such that n= lg n D O.n log b a\\ue002\\ue001 /, which is required \\nfor case 1 to apply.

This section, however, states and proves a va riant of the master theorem, \\ncalled the continuous master theorem 1 in which the master recurrence (4.17) is \\ndeûned over sufûciently large positive real numbers. The proof of this version, \\nuncomplicated by üoors and ceilings, contains the main ideas needed to understand \\nhow master recurrences behave. Section 4.7 discusses üoors and ceilings in divide- \\nand-conquer recurrences at greater length, presenting sufûcient conditions for them \\nnot to affect the asymptotic solutions. \\nOf course, since you need not understand the proof of the master theorem in \\norder to apply the master method, you may choose to skip this section. But if you \\nwish to study more-advanced algorithms beyond the scope of this textbook, you \\nmay appreciate a better understanding of the underl ying mathematics, which the \\nproof of the continuous master theorem provides. \\nAlthough we usually assume that recurrences are alg orithmic and don’t require \\nan explicit statement of a base case, we must be much more careful for proofs that \\njustify the practice. The lemmas and theorem in this section explicitly state the base \\ncases, because the inductive proofs require mathematical grounding. It is common \\nin the world of mathematics to be extraordinarily c areful proving theorems that \\njustify acting more casually in practice. \\nThe proof of the continuous master theorem involves two lemm as. Lemma 4.2 \\nuses a slightly simpliûed master recurrence with a threshold constant of n 0 D 1, \\nrather than the more general n 0 >0 threshold constant implied by the unstated base \\ncase. The lemma employs a recursion tree to reduce the solution of the simpliûed \\nmaster recurrence to that of evaluating a summation. Lemma 4.3 then provides \\nasymptotic bounds for the summation, mirroring the three cases of the master the- \\norem. Finally, the continuous master theorem itself  (Theorem 4.4) gives asymp- \\ntotic bounds for master recurrences, while generali zing to an arbitrary threshold \\nconstant n 0 >0 as implied by the unstated base case. \\n1 This terminology does not mean that either T.n/ or f.n/ need be continuous, only that the domain \\nof T.n/ is the real numbers, as opposed to integers.

The ûrst deals with technicalities arising from the use of \\nüoors and ceilings, and the second discusses the Akra-Bazzi method, which in- \\nvolves a little calculus, for solving complicated divide-and-conquer recurrences. \\nIn particular, we’ll look at the class of algorithmic divide-and-conquer recur- \\nrences originally studied by M. Akra and L. Bazzi [13]. These Akra-Bazzi recur- \\nrences take the form \\nT.n/ D f.n/ C \\nk X \\ni D1 \\na i T.n=b i /; (4.22) \\nwhere k is a positive integer; all the constants a 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  k 2 R are strictly posi- \\ntive; all the constants b 1 ;b 2 ;:::;b  k 2 R are strictly greater than 1; and the driving \\nfunction f.n/ is deûned on sufûciently large nonnegative reals and is itself non- \\nnegative. \\nAkra-Bazzi recurrences generalize the class of recurrences addressed by the \\nmaster theorem. Whereas master recurrences characte rize the running times of \\ndivide-and-conquer algorithms that break a problem into equal-sized subproblems \\n(modulo üoors and ceilings), Akra-Bazzi recurrences can describe the running time \\nof divide-and-conquer algorithms that break a problem into different-sized sub- \\nproblems. The master theorem, however, allows you to ignore üoors and ceilings, \\nbut the Akra-Bazzi method for solving Akra-Bazzi recurrences needs an additional \\nrequirement to deal with üoors and ceilings. \\nBut before diving into the Akra-Bazzi method itself, let’s understand the lim- \\nitations involved in ignoring üoors and ceilings in Akra-Bazzi recurrences. As \\nyou’re aware, algorithms generally deal with integer-sized inputs. The mathemat- \\nics for recurrences is often easier with real numbe rs, however, than with integers, \\nwhere we must cope with üoors and ceilings to ensure that terms are well deûned. \\nThe difference may not seem to be much4especially because that’s often the truth \\nwith recurrences4but to be mathematically correct, we must be careful with our '),\n",

Since our end goal is to understand al gorithms and not the vagaries \\nof mathematical corner cases, we’d like to be casual yet rigorous. How can we \\ntreat üoors and ceilings casually while still ensuring rigor? \\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the difûculty in dealing with üoors and \\nceilings is that some driving functions can be really, really weird. So it’s not okay in \\ngeneral to ignore üoors and ceilings in Akra-Bazzi recurrences. Fortunately, most \\nof the driving functions we encounter in the study of algorithms behave nicely, and \\nüoors and ceilings don’t make a difference. \\nThe polynomial-growth condition \\nIf the driving function f.n/ in equation (4.22) is well behaved in the following \\nsense, it’s okay to drop üoors and ceilings. \\nA function f.n/ deûned on all sufûciently large positive reals satisûes the \\npolynomial-growth condition if there exists a constant y n>0  such that the \\nfollowing holds: for every constant � \\ue004 1, there exists a constant d > 1 \\n(depending on �) such that f.n/=d හ f.\\ue001n/ හ df.n/ for all 1 හ \\ue001 හ � \\nand n \\ue004 y n. \\nThis deûnition may be one of the hardest in this textbook to get your head around. \\nTo a ûrst order, it says that f.n/ satisûes the property that f.‚.n// D ‚.f.n//, \\nalthough the polynomial-growth condition is actually somewhat stronger (see Ex- \\nercise 4.7-4). The deûnition also implies that f.n/ is asymptotically positive (see \\nExercise 4.7-3). \\nExamples of functions that satisfy the polynomial-growth condition include any \\nfunction of the form f.n/ D ‚.n ˛ lg ˇ n lg lg \\ue002 n/, where ˛, ˇ, and � are constants. \\nMost of the polynomially bounded functions used in this book satisfy the condition. \\nExponentials and superexponentials do not (see Exercise 4.7-2, for example), and \\nthere also exist polynomially bounded functions that do not. \\nFloors and ceilings in <nice= recurrences \\nWhen the driving function in an Akra-Bazzi recurrence satisûes the polynomial- \\ngrowth condition, üoors and ceilings don’t change the asymptotic behavior of the \\nsolution. The following theorem, which is presented without proof, formalizes this \\nnotion. \\nTheorem 4.5 \\nLet T.n/ be a function deûned on the nonnegative reals that satisûes recur- \\nrence (4.22), where f.n/ satisûes the polynomial-growth condition. Let T 0 .n/ be \\nanother function deûned on the natural numbers also satisfying recurrence (4.22), '),\n",

By inequality (3.2) on page 64, they perturb an argument by at most 1. \\nBut much larger perturbations are tolerable. As lon g as the driving function f.n/ \\nin recurrence (4.22) satisûes the polynomial-growth condition, it turns out that re- \\nplacing any term T.n=b i / with T.n=b i C h i .n//, where jh i .n/j D O.n= lg 1C\\ue001 n/ \\nfor some constant � > 0 and sufûciently large n, leaves the asymptotic solution \\nunaffected. Thus, the divide step in a divide-and-conquer algorithm can be moder- \\nately coarse without affecting the solution to its running-time recurrence. \\nThe Akra-Bazzi method \\nThe Akra-Bazzi method, not surprisingly, was developed to solve Akra-Bazzi re- \\ncurrences (4.22), which by dint of Theorem 4.5, applies in the presence of üoors \\nand ceilings or even larger perturbations, as just discussed. The method involves \\nûrst determining the unique real number p such that P k \\ni D1 a i =b p \\ni D 1. Such a p \\nalways exists, because when p ! \\ue0031 , the sum goes to 1; it decreases as p in- \\ncreases; and when p ! 1 , it goes to 0.

This recurrence has the \\nform of equation (4.22), where a 1 D a 2 D 1, b 1 D 5, b 2 D 10=7, and f.n/ D n. \\nTo solve it, the Akra-Bazzi method says that we should determine the unique p \\nsatisfying \\nÎ 1 \\n5 \\nÏ p \\nC \\nÎ 7 \\n10 \\nÏ p \\nD 1: \\nSolving for p is kind of messy4it turns out that p D 0:83978::: 4but we can \\nsolve the recurrence without actually knowing the exact value for p.

Gauss \\ndevised the ûrst fast Fourier transform algorithm in 1805, and Gauss’s formulation \\nbreaks the problem into smaller subproblems whose solutions are combined. \\nStrassen’s algorithm [424] caused much excitement when it appeared in 1969. \\nBefore then, few imagined the possibility of an algorithm asymptotically faster than \\nthe basic MATRIX -MULTIPLY procedure. Shortly thereafter, S. Winograd reduced \\nthe number of submatrix additions from 18 to 15 while still using seven submatrix \\nmultiplications. This improvement, which Winograd a pparently never published \\n(and which is frequently miscited in the literature ), may enhance the practicality \\nof the method, but it does not affect its asymptoti c performa nce. Probert [368] \\ndescribed Winograd’s algorithm and showed that with seven multiplications, 15 \\nadditions is the minimum possible. \\nStrassen’s ‚.n lg 7 / D O.n 2:81 / bound for matrix multiplication held until 1987, \\nwhen Coppersmith and Winograd [103] made a signiûcant advance, improving the '),\n",

The French \\nmathematician De Moivre [108] introduced the method of generating functions \\nwith which he studied Fibonacci numbers (see Problem 4-5). Knuth [259] and \\nLiu [302] are good resources for learning the method of generating functions. \\nAho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5, 6] offered one of the ûrst general methods for \\nsolving recurrences arising from the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms. \\nThe master method was adapted from Bentley, Haken, and Saxe [ 52]. The Akra- \\nBazzi method is due (unsurprisingly) to Akra and Bazzi [13]. Divide-and-conquer \\nrecurrences have been studied by many researchers, including Campbell [79], Gra- \\nham, Knuth, and Patashnik [199], Kuszmaul and Leiserson [274], Leighton [287], \\nPurdom and Brown [371], Roura [389], Verma [447], and Yap [462]. \\nThe issue of üoors and ceilings in divide-and-conquer recurrences, including a \\ntheorem similar to Theorem 4.5, was studied by Leighton [287]. Leighton pro- \\nposed a version of the polynomial-growth condition. Campbell [79] removed sev- \\neral limitations in Leighton’s statement of it and showed that there were polyno- \\nmially bounded functions that do not satisfy Leighton’s condition. Campbell also \\ncarefully studied many other technical issues, incl uding t he well-deûnedness of \\ndivide-and-conquer recurrences.

If you \\nare unfamiliar with the basics of probability theor y, you should read Sections \\nC.13C.4 of Appendix C, which review this material. We’ll revisit probabilistic \\nanalysis and randomized algorithms several times throughout this book. \\n5.1 The hiring problem \\nSuppose that you need to hire a new ofûce assistant. Your previous attempts at \\nhiring have been unsuccessful, and you decide to use an employment agency. The \\nemployment agency sends you one candidate each day. You interview that person \\nand then decide either to hire that person or not. You must pay the employment \\nagency a small fee to interview an applicant. To actually hire an applicant is more \\ncostly, however, since you must ûre your current ofûce assistant and also pay a \\nsubstantial hiring fee to the employment agency. You are committed to having, at \\nall times, the best possible person for the job. Th erefore, you decide that, after \\ninterviewing each applicant, if that applicant is b etter qu aliûed than the current \\nofûce assistant, you will ûre the current ofûce assistant and hire the new applicant. \\nYou are willing to pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate \\nwhat that price will be. \\nThe procedure HIRE -ASSISTANT on the facing page expresses this strategy for \\nhiring in pseudocode. The candidates for the ofûce assistant job are numbered 1 \\nthrough n and interviewed in that order. The procedure assume s that af ter inter- \\nviewing candidate i , you can determine whether candidate i is the best candidate \\nyou have seen so far. It starts by creating a dummy candidate, numbered 0, who is \\nless qualiûed than each of the other candidates. \\nThe cost model for this problem differs from the model described in Chapter 2. \\nWe focus not on the running time of HIRE -ASSISTANT , but instead on the fees paid \\nfor interviewing and hiring. On the surface, analyzing the cost of this algorithm '),\n",

The \\nanalytical techniques used, however, are identical whether we are analyzing cost \\nor running time. In either case, we are counting th e number of times certain basic \\noperations are executed. \\nInterviewing has a low cost, say c i , whereas hiring is expensive, costing c h . Let- \\nting m be the number of people hired, the total cost associated with this algorithm \\nis O.c i n C c h m/. No matter how many people you hire, you always in terview n \\ncandidates and thus always incur the cost c i n associated with interviewing. We \\ntherefore concentrate on analyzing c h m, the hiring cost. This quantity depends on \\nthe order in which you interview candidates. \\nThis scenario serves as a model for a common comput ational pa radigm. Al- \\ngorithms often need to ûnd the maximum or minimum value in a sequence by \\nexamining each element of the sequence and maintaining a current <winner.= The \\nhiring problem models how often a procedure updates its notion of which element \\nis currently winning. \\nWorst-case analysis \\nIn the worst case, you actually hire every candidate that you interview. This situa- \\ntion occurs if the candidates come in strictly incr easing order of quality, in which \\ncase you hire n times, for a total hiring cost of O.c h n/. \\nOf course, the candidates do not always come in increasing order of quality. In \\nfact, you have no idea about the order in which the y arrive, nor do you have any \\ncontrol over this order. Therefore, it is natural to ask what we expect to happen in \\na typical or average case. \\nProbabilistic analysis \\nProbabilistic analysis is the use of probability in the analysis of proble ms. Most \\ncommonly, we use probabilistic analysis to analyze the running time of an algo- \\nrithm. Sometimes we use it to analyze other quantit ies, such as the hiring cost in '),\n",

In order to perform a probabilistic analysis, we must \\nuse knowledge of, or make assumptions about, the distribution of the inputs. Then \\nwe analyze our algorithm, computing an average-case running time, where we take \\nthe average, or expected value, over the distribution of the possible inputs. When \\nreporting such a running time, we refer to it as the average-case running time. \\nYou must be careful in deciding on the distribution of inputs. For some problems, \\nyou may reasonably assume something about the set o f all possible inputs, and \\nthen you can use probabilistic analysis as a techni que for de signing an efûcient \\nalgorithm and as a means for gaining insight into a  problem. For other problems, \\nyou cannot characterize a reasonable input distribu tion, and in these cases you \\ncannot use probabilistic analysis. \\nFor the hiring problem, we can assume that the appl icants come in a random \\norder. What does that mean for this problem? We assume that you can compare \\nany two candidates and decide which one is better qualiûed, which is to say that \\nthere is a total order on the candidates. (See Section B.2 for the deûnition of a total \\norder.) Thus, you can rank each candidate with a unique number from 1 through n, \\nusing rank.i/ to denote the rank of applicant i , and adopt the convention that a \\nhigher rank corresponds to a better qualiûed applicant. The ordered list hrank.1/; \\nrank.2/;:::;  rank.n/i is a permutation of the list h1;2;:::;n i. Saying that the \\napplicants come in a random order is equivalent to saying that this list of ranks is \\nequally likely to be any one of the nŠ permutations of the numbers 1 through n. \\nAlternatively, we say that the ranks form a uniform random permutation, that is, \\neach of the possible nŠ permutations appears with equal probability. \\nSection 5.2 contains a probabilistic analysis of the hiring problem. \\nRandomized algorithms \\nIn order to use probabilistic analysis, you need to  know something about the dis- \\ntribution of the inputs. In many cases, you know li ttle about the input distribu- \\ntion. Even if you do know something about the distribution, you might not be able \\nto model this knowledge computationally. Yet, proba bility and randomness often \\nserve as tools for algorithm design and analysis, b y making part of the algorithm \\nbehave randomly. \\nIn the hiring problem, it may seem as if the candid ates are being presented to \\nyou in a random order, but you have no way of knowi ng whether they really are. \\nThus, in order to develop a randomized algorithm for the hiring problem, you need \\ngreater control over the order in which you’ll interview the candidates. We will, \\ntherefore, change the model slightly. The employmen t agency sends you a list of \\nthe n candidates in advance. On each day, you choose, randomly, which candi- \\ndate to interview. Although you know nothing about the candidates (besides their \\nnames), we have made a signiûcant change. Instead of accepting the order given '),\n",

For example, R ANDOM.0;1/ produces 0 with \\nprobability 1=2, and it produces 1 with probability 1=2. A call to R ANDOM.3;7/ \\nreturns any one of 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, each with probability 1=5. Each integer returned \\nby R ANDOM is independent of the integers returned on previous  calls. You may \\nimagine RANDOM as rolling a .b \\ue003 a C 1/-sided die to obtain its output. (In prac- \\ntice, most programming environments offer a pseudorandom-number generator: \\na deterministic algorithm returning numbers that <look= statistically random.) \\nWhen analyzing the running time of a randomized algorithm, we take the expec- \\ntation of the running time over the distribution of  values returned by the random \\nnumber generator. We distinguish these algorithms f rom those in which the input \\nis random by referring to the running time of a ran domized algorithm as an ex- \\npected running time. In general, we discuss the average-case running time when \\nthe probability distribution is over the inputs to the algorithm, and we discuss the \\nexpected running time when the algorithm itself makes random choices. \\nExercises \\n5.1-1 \\nShow that the assumption that you are always able to determine which candidate is \\nbest, in line 4 of procedure HIRE -ASSISTANT , implies that you know a total order \\non the ranks of the candidates. \\n? 5.1-2 \\nDescribe an implementation of the procedure RANDOM.a;b/ that makes calls only \\nto R ANDOM.0;1/.

The sample space for a single coin üip is S D fH;T g, \\nwith Pr fH g D  Pr fT g D  1=2. We can then deûne an indicator random vari- \\nable X H , associated with the coin coming up heads, which i s the event H . This \\nvariable counts the number of heads obtained in this üip, and it is 1 if the coin \\ncomes up heads and 0 otherwise. We write \\nX H D I fH g \\nD \\n( \\n1 if H occurs ; \\n0 if T occurs : \\nThe expected number of heads obtained in one üip of the coin is simply the ex- \\npected value of our indicator variable X H : \\nE ŒX H � D E ŒI fH g� \\nD 1 \\ue001 Pr fH g C 0 \\ue001 Pr fT g \\nD 1 \\ue001 .1=2/ C 0 \\ue001 .1=2/ \\nD 1=2: \\nThus the expected number of heads obtained by one üip of a fair coin is 1=2.

In \\nAppendix C, for example, indicator random variables  provide a simple way to \\ndetermine the expected number of heads in n coin üips. One option is to con- \\nsider separately the probability of obtaining 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, etc. to ar- \\nrive at the result of equation (C.41) on page 1199. Alternati vely, we can employ \\nthe simpler method proposed in equation (C.42), which uses indicator random \\nvariables implicitly. Making this argument more exp licit, let X i be the indicator \\nrandom variable associated with the event in which the i th üip comes up heads: \\nX i D I fthe i th üip results in the event H g.

How can we resolve this conundrum? Linearity of expectation, equa- \\ntion (C.24) on page 1192, to the rescue: the expectation of the sum always equals \\nthe sum of the expectations. Linearity of expectation applies even when there is \\ndependence among the random variables.

This algorithm is deterministic: for any particul ar input, the \\nnumber of times a new ofûce assistant is hired is always the same. Furthermore, \\nthe number of times you hire a new ofûce assistant differs for different inputs, \\nand it depends on the ranks of the various candidat es. Since this number depends \\nonly on the ranks of the candidates, to represent a  particular input, we can just \\nlist, in order, the ranks hrank.1/; rank.2/;:::;  rank.n/i of the candidates. Given \\nthe rank list A 1 D h 1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10 i, a new ofûce assistant is always \\nhired 10 times, since each successive candidate is better than the previous one, and \\nlines 536 of HIRE -ASSISTANT are executed in each iteration.

Given a list of ranks A 3 D h5;2;1;8;4;7;10;9;3;6 i, a new \\nofûce assistant is hired three times, upon interviewing the candidates with ranks 5, \\n8, and 10. Recalling that the cost of our algorithm depends on how many times \\nyou hire a new ofûce assistant, we see that there are expensive inputs such as A 1 , \\ninexpensive inputs such as A 2 , and moderately expensive inputs such as A 3 . \\nConsider, on the other hand, the randomized algorithm that ûrst permutes the list \\nof candidates and then determines the best candidate. In this case, we randomize in \\nthe algorithm, not in the input distribution. Given a particular input, say A 3 above, \\nwe cannot say how many times the maximum is updated , because this quantity \\ndiffers with each run of the algorithm. The ûrst time you run the algorithm on A 3 , \\nit might produce the permutation A 1 and perform 10 updates. But the second \\ntime you run the algorithm, it might produce the permutation A 2 and perform only \\none update. The third time you run the algorithm, i t might perform some other \\nnumber of updates. Each time you run the algorithm,  its execution depends on \\nthe random choices made and is likely to differ from the previous execution of the \\nalgorithm. For this algorithm and many other randomized algorithms, no particular \\ninput elicits its worst-case behavior. Even your worst enemy cannot produce a \\nbad input array, since the random permutation makes  the input order irrelevant. \\nThe randomized algorithm performs badly only if the random-number generator \\nproduces an <unlucky= permutation. \\nFor the hiring problem, the only change needed in t he code is to randomly per- \\nmute the array, as done in the R ANDOMIZED -HIRE -ASSISTANT procedure. This \\nsimple change creates a randomized algorithm whose performance matches that \\nobtained by assuming that the candidates were presented in a random order. \\nRANDOMIZED -HIRE -ASSISTANT .n/ \\n1 randomly permute the list of candidates \\n2 HIRE -ASSISTANT .n/ '),\n",

Lemma 5.2 makes an assump- \\ntion about the input. Lemma 5.3 makes no such assumption, although randomizing \\nthe input takes some additional time. To remain con sistent with our terminology, \\nwe couched Lemma 5.2 in terms of the average-case hiring cost and Lemma 5.3 in \\nterms of the expected hiring cost. In the remainder of this section, we discuss some \\nissues involved in randomly permuting inputs. \\nRandomly permuting arrays \\nMany randomized algorithms randomize the input by p ermuting a given input ar- \\nray. We’ll see elsewhere in this book other ways to randomize an algorithm, but \\nnow, let’s see how we can randomly permute an array of n elements. The goal is \\nto produce a \\nuniform random permutation, that is, a permutation that is as likely \\nas any other permutation. Since there are nŠ possible permutations, we want the \\nprobability that any particular permutation is produced to be 1=nŠ. \\nYou might think that to prove that a permutation is a uniform random permuta- \\ntion, it sufûces to show that, for each element AŒi�, the probability that the element \\nwinds up in position j is 1=n. Exercise 5.3-4 shows that this weaker condition is, \\nin fact, insufûcient. \\nOur method to generate a random permutation permutes the array in place: at \\nmost a constant number of elements of the input arr ay are ever stored outside the \\narray. The procedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE permutes an array AŒ1 W n� in place in \\n‚.n/ time. In its i th iteration, it chooses the element AŒi� randomly from among \\nelements AŒi� through AŒn�.

(See page 1180 in \\nAppendix C.) There are nŠ=.n \\ue003 k/Š such possible k-permutations. \\nLemma 5.4 \\nProcedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE computes a uniform random permutation. \\nProof We use the following loop invariant: \\nJust prior to the i th iteration of the for loop of lines 132, for each possible \\n.i \\ue003 1/-permutation of the n elements, the subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1� contains this \\n.i \\ue003 1/-permutation with probability .n \\ue003 i C 1/Š=nŠ. \\nWe need to show that this invariant is true prior to the ûrst loop iteration, that each \\niteration of the loop maintains the invariant, that  the loop terminates, and that the \\ninvariant provides a useful property to show correctness when the loop terminates. \\nInitialization: Consider the situation just before the ûrst loop iteration, so that \\ni D 1. The loop invariant says that for each possible 0-permutation, the sub- \\narray AŒ1 W 0� contains this 0-permutation with probability .n \\ue003 i C 1/Š=nŠ D \\nnŠ=nŠ D 1. The subarray AŒ1 W 0� is an empty subarray, and a 0-permutation has \\nno elements. Thus, AŒ1 W 0� contains any 0-permutation with probability 1, and \\nthe loop invariant holds prior to the ûrst iteration. \\nMaintenance: By the loop invariant, we assume that just before the i th iteration, \\neach possible .i \\ue003 1/-permutation appears in the subarray AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1� with prob- \\nability .n \\ue003 i C 1/Š=nŠ. We shall show that after the i th iteration, each possible \\ni -permutation appears in the subarray AŒ1 W i� with probability .n \\ue003 i/Š=nŠ. In- \\ncrementing i for the next iteration then maintains the loop invariant. \\nLet us examine the i th iteration. Consider a particular i -permutation, and de- \\nnote the elements in it by hx 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  i i. This permutation consists of an \\n.i \\ue003 1/-permutation hx 1 ;:::;x  i \\ue0021 i followed by the value x i that the algorithm \\nplaces in AŒi�. Let E 1 denote the event in which the ûrst i \\ue003 1 iterations have \\ncreated the particular .i \\ue003 1/-permutation hx 1 ;:::;x  i \\ue0021 i in AŒ1 W i \\ue003 1�.

The i -permutation hx 1 ;:::;x  i i appears \\nin AŒ1 W i� precisely when both E 1 and E 2 occur, and so we wish to compute \\nPr fE 2 \\\\ E 1 g.

The third investigates <streaks= of consecutive heads \\nwhen üipping coins. The ûnal example analyzes a variant of the hiring problem in \\nwhich you have to make decisions without actually interviewing all the candidates. \\n5.4.1 The birthday paradox \\nOur ûrst example is the birthday paradox. How many people must there be in a \\nroom before there is a 50% chance that two of them were born on the same day of \\nthe year? The answer is surprisingly few. The paradox is that it is in fact far fewer \\nthan the number of days in a year, or even half the number of days in a year, as we \\nshall see. \\nTo answer this question, we index the people in the  room with the integers \\n1;2;:::;k , where k is the number of people in the room. We ignore the issue \\nof leap years and assume that all years have n D 365 days. For i D 1;2;:::;k , \\nlet b i be the day of the year on which person i ’s birthday falls, where 1 හ b i හ n. \\nWe also assume that birthdays are uniformly distrib uted across the n days of the \\nyear, so that Pr fb i D r g D 1=n for i D 1;2;:::;k  and r D 1;2;:::;n . \\nThe probability that two given people, say i and j , have matching birthdays \\ndepends on whether the random selection of birthdays is independent. We assume \\nfrom now on that birthdays are independent, so that the probability that i ’s birthday \\nand j ’s birthday both fall on day r is \\nPr fb i D r and b j D r g D  Pr fb i D r g Pr fb j D r g \\nD 1 \\nn 2 : \\nThus, the probability that they both fall on the same day is \\nPr fb i D b j g D  \\nn X \\nr D1 \\nPr fb i D r and b j D r g '),\n",

The probability that at least two \\nof the birthdays match is 1 minus the probability that all the birthdays are different. \\nThe event B k that k people have distinct birthdays is \\nB k D \\nk \\\\ \\ni D1 \\nA i ; \\nwhere A i is the event that person i ’s birthday is different from person j ’s for \\nall j <i .

If we view the ball-tossing process as a sequence of Bernoulli trials (see \\nAppendix C.4), where success means that the ball falls in the given bin, then each \\ntrial has a probability 1=b of success. This model is particularly useful for analyz- \\ning hashing (see Chapter 11), and we can answer a variety of interesting questions \\nabout the ball-tossing process. (Problem C-2 asks additional questions about balls \\nand bins.) \\n\\ue001 How many balls fall in a given bin? The number of balls that fall in a given \\nbin follows the binomial distribution b.kI n;1=b/. If you toss n balls, equa- \\ntion (C.41) on page 1199 tells us that the expected number of balls that fall in \\nthe given bin is n=b. \\n\\ue001 How many balls must you toss, on the average, until a given bin contains a ball? \\nThe number of tosses until the given bin receives a  ball follows the geometric \\ndistribution with probability 1=b and, by equation (C.36) on page 1197, the \\nexpected number of tosses until success is 1=.1=b/ D b. \\n\\ue001 How many balls must you toss until every bin contains at least one ball?

The i th stage consists \\nof the tosses after the .i \\ue003 1/st hit up to and including the i th hit.

Suppose now \\nthat you do not wish to interview all the candidate s in order t o ûnd the best one. \\nYou also want to avoid hiring and ûring as you ûnd better and better applicants. \\nInstead, you are willing to settle for a candidate who is clos e to the best, in ex- \\nchange for hiring exactly once. You must obey one c ompany requirement: after \\neach interview you must either immediately offer th e position to the applicant or \\nimmediately reject the applicant. What is the trade-off between minimizing the \\namount of interviewing and maximizing the quality of the candidate hired? \\nWe can model this problem in the following way. Aft er meeting an applicant, \\nyou are able to give each one a score. Let score.i/ denote the score you give to \\nthe i th applicant, and assume that no two applicants receive the same score. After \\nyou have seen j applicants, you know which of the j has the highest score, but \\nyou do not know whether any of the remaining n \\ue003 j applicants will receive a \\nhigher score. You decide to adopt the strategy of selecting a positive integer k<n , \\ninterviewing and then rejecting the ûrst k applicants, and hiring the ûrst applicant \\nthereafter who has a higher score than all preceding applicants. If it turns out that \\nthe best-qualiûed applicant was among the ûrst k interviewed, then you hire the nth \\napplicant4the last one interviewed.

Let S be the event that you succeed in choosing the best-qualiûed \\napplicant, and let S i be the event that you succeed when the best-qualiûed appli- \\ncant is the i th one interviewed. Since the various S i are disjoint, we have that \\nPr fS g D  P n \\ni D1 Pr fS i g. Noting that you never succeed when the best-qualiûed \\napplicant is one of the ûrst k, we have that Pr fS i g D 0 for i D 1;2;:::;k . Thus, \\nwe obtain \\nPr fS g D \\nn X \\ni DkC1 \\nPr fS i g : (5.14) \\nWe now compute Pr fS i g. In order to succeed when the best-qualiûed applicant \\nis the i th one, two things must happen. First, the best-qualiûed applicant must be in \\nposition i , an event which we denote by B i . Second, the algorithm must not select \\nany of the applicants in positions k C 1 through i \\ue003 1, which happens only if, for \\neach j such that k C 1 හ j හ i \\ue003 1, line 6 ûnds that score.j/<  best-score. (Be- \\ncause scores are unique, we can ignore the possibil ity of score.j/ D best-score.) \\nIn other words, all of the values score.k C 1/ through score.i \\ue003 1/ must be less \\nthan M.k/. If any are greater than M.k/, the algorithm instead returns the index \\nof the ûrst one that is greater. We use O i to denote the event that none of the ap- \\nplicants in position k C 1 through i \\ue003 1 are chosen. Fortunately, the two events B i \\nand O i are independent. The event O i depends only on the relative ordering of the \\nvalues in positions 1 through i \\ue003 1, whereas B i depends only on whether the value \\nin position i is greater than the values in all other positions. The ordering of the \\nvalues in positions 1 through i \\ue003 1 does not affect whether the value in position i \\nis greater than all of them, and the value in posit ion i does not affect the ordering \\nof the values in positions 1 through i \\ue003 1. Thus, we can apply equation (C.17) on \\npage 1188 to obtain \\nPr fS i g D Pr fB i \\\\ O i g D Pr fB i g Pr fO i g : \\nWe have Pr fB i g D 1=n since the maximum is equally likely to be in any one of the \\nn positions. For event O i to occur, the maximum value in positions 1 through i \\ue003 1, \\nwhich is equally likely to be in any of these i \\ue003 1 positions, must be in one of the \\nûrst k positions. Consequently, Pr fO i g D k=.i \\ue003 1/ and Pr fS i g D k=.n.i \\ue003 1//. \\nUsing equation (5.14), we have \\nPr fS g D  \\nn X \\ni DkC1 \\nPr fS i g \\nD \\nn X \\ni DkC1 \\nk \\nn.i \\ue003 1/ '),\n",

The remainder of the record consists of satellite data, which are \\nusually carried around with the key.

There are several reasons: \\n\\ue001 Sometimes an application inherently needs to sort i nformation. For example, \\nin order to prepare customer statements, banks need  to sort checks by check \\nnumber. \\n\\ue001 Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine. F or example, a program that \\nrenders graphical objects which are layered on top of each other might have \\nto sort the objects according to an <above= relatio n so that it can draw these \\nobjects from bottom to top. We will see numerous al gorithms in this text that \\nuse sorting as a subroutine. \\n\\ue001 We can draw from among a wide variety of sorting algorithms, and they employ \\na rich set of techniques. In fact, many important t echniques used throughout \\nalgorithm design appear in sorting algorithms that have been developed over \\nthe years. In this way, sorting is also a problem of historical interest. \\n\\ue001 We can prove a nontrivial lower bound for sorting (as we’ll do in Chapter 8). \\nSince the best upper bounds match the lower bound asymptotically, we can con- \\nclude that certain of our sorting algorithms are as ymptotically optimal. More- \\nover, we can use the lower bound for sorting to prove lower bounds for various \\nother problems. \\n\\ue001 Many engineering issues come to the fore when imple menting s orting algo- \\nrithms. The fastest sorting program for a particula r situation may depend on \\nmany factors, such as prior knowledge about the key s and satellite data, the \\nmemory hierarchy (caches and virtual memory) of the  host computer, and the \\nsoftware environment. Many of these issues are best dealt with at the algorith- \\nmic level, rather than by <tweaking= the code. \\nSorting algorithms \\nWe introduced two algorithms that sort n real numbers in Chapter 2. Insertion sort \\ntakes ‚.n 2 / time in the worst case. Because its inner loops are tight, however, it is \\na fast sorting algorithm for small input sizes. Moreover, unlike merge sort, it sorts \\nin place, meaning that at most a constant number of element s of the input array \\nare ever stored outside the array, which can be adv antageous for space efûciency. \\nMerge sort has a better asymptotic running time, ‚.n lg n/, but the MERGE proce- \\ndure it uses does not operate in place.

Heap- \\nsort, presented in Chapter 6, sorts n numbers in place in O.n lg n/ time. It uses an \\nimportant data structure, called a heap, which can also implement a priority queue. \\nQuicksort, in Chapter 7, also sorts n numbers in place, but its worst-case running \\ntime is ‚.n 2 /. Its expected running time is ‚.n lg n/, however, and it generally \\noutperforms heapsort in practice. Like insertion sort, quicksort has tight code, and \\nso the hidden constant factor in its running time is small. It is a popular algorithm \\nfor sorting large arrays. \\nInsertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort are all comparison sorts: they \\ndetermine the sorted order of an input array by comparing elements. Chapter 8 be- \\ngins by introducing the decision-tree model in order to study the performance limi- \\ntations of comparison sorts. Using this model, we prove a lower bound of �.n lg n/ \\non the worst-case running time of any comparison sort on n inputs, thus showing \\nthat heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts. \\nChapter 8 then goes on to show that we might be able to beat this lower bound \\nof �.n lg n/ if an algorithm can gather information about the so rted order of the \\ninput by means other than comparing elements. The c ounting sort algorithm, for \\nexample, assumes that the input numbers belong to the set f0;1;:::;k g. By using \\narray indexing as a tool for determining relative o rder, counting sort can sort n \\nnumbers in ‚.k C n/ time. Thus, when k D O.n/, counting sort runs in time that \\nis linear in the size of the input array. A related  algorithm, radix sort, can be used \\nto extend the range of counting sort. If there are n integers to sort, each integer \\nhas d digits, and each digit can take on up to k possible values, then radix sort can \\nsort the numbers in ‚.d.n C k// time. When d is a constant and k is O.n/, radix \\nsort runs in linear time. A third algorithm, bucket  sort, requires knowledge of the \\nprobabilistic distribution of numbers in the input array. It can sort n real numbers \\nuniformly distributed in the half-open interval Œ0;1/ in average-case O.n/ time. \\nThe table on the following page summarizes the running times of the sorting al- \\ngorithms from Chapters 2 and 638. As usual, n denotes the number of items to sort. \\nFor counting sort, the items to sort are integers i n the set f0;1;:::;k g. For radix \\nsort, each item is a d -digit number, where each digit takes on k possible values. For \\nbucket sort, we assume that the keys are real numbers uniformly distributed in the \\nhalf-open interval Œ0;1/. The rightmost column gives the average-case or expected \\nrunning time, indicating which one it gives when it differs from the worst-case run- \\nning time. We omit the average-case running time of heapsort because we do not \\nanalyze it in this book. '),\n",

Like merge sort, but \\nunlike insertion sort, heapsort’s running time is O.n lg n/. Like insertion sort, but \\nunlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array elements \\nare stored outside the input array at any time. Thu s, heapsort combines the better \\nattributes of the two sorting algorithms we have already discussed. \\nHeapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique: using a data struc- \\nture, in this case one we call a <heap,= to manage information. Not only is the heap \\ndata structure useful for heapsort, but it also makes an efûcient priority queue. The \\nheap data structure will reappear in algorithms in later chapters. \\nThe term <heap= was originally coined in the context of heapsort, but it has since \\ncome to refer to <garbage-collected storage,= such as the programming languages \\nJava and Python provide. Please don’t be confused. The heap data structure is not \\ngarbage-collected storage. This book is consistent in using the term <heap= to refer \\nto the data structure, not the storage class. \\n6.1 Heaps \\nThe (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly \\ncomplete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1.

Never- \\ntheless, the heap data structure itself has many uses. In this section, we present one \\nof the most popular applications of a heap: as an efûcient priority queue. As with \\nheaps, priority queues come in two forms: max-priority queues and min-priority \\nqueues. We’ll focus here on how to implement max-priority queues, which are \\nin turn based on max-heaps. Exercise 6.5-3 asks you to write the procedures for \\nmin-priority queues. '),\n",

A max-priority queue supports the following \\noperations: \\nI NSERT .S;x;k/  inserts the element x with key k into the set S , which is equivalent \\nto the operation S D S [ fx g. \\nMAXIMUM .S/ returns the element of S with the largest key. \\nEXTRACT -MAX.S/ removes and returns the element of S with the largest key. \\nI NCREASE -KEY .S;x;k/  increases the value of element x ’s key to the new value k, \\nwhich is assumed to be at least as large as x ’s current key value. \\nAmong their other applications, you can use max-priority queues to schedule \\njobs on a computer shared among multiple users. The max-priority queue keeps \\ntrack of the jobs to be performed and their relativ e priorities. When a job is ûn- \\nished or interrupted, the scheduler selects the highest-priority job from among \\nthose pending by calling E XTRACT -MAX. The scheduler can add a new job to \\nthe queue at any time by calling I NSERT . \\nAlternatively, a min-priority queue supports the operations I NSERT , MINIMUM , \\nEXTRACT -MIN, and D ECREASE -KEY. A min-priority queue can be used in an \\nevent-driven simulator. The items in the queue are events to be simulated, each \\nwith an associated time of occurrence that serves a s its key. The events must be \\nsimulated in order of their time of occurrence, bec ause the simulation of an event \\ncan cause other events to be simulated in the future. The simulation program calls \\nEXTRACT -MIN at each step to choose the next event to simulate. As new events are \\nproduced, the simulator inserts them into the min-priority queue by calling I NSERT . \\nWe’ll see other uses for min-priority queues, highlighting the D ECREASE -KEY \\noperation, in Chapters 21 and 22. \\nWhen you use a heap to implement a priority queue w ithin a given application, \\nelements of the priority queue correspond to object s in the a pplication. Each ob- \\nject contains a key. If the priority queue is imple mented by a heap, you need to \\ndetermine which application object corresponds to a given heap element, and vice \\nversa. Because the heap elements are stored in an a rray, you need a way to map \\napplication objects to and from array indices. \\nOne way to map between application objects and heap elements uses handles, \\nwhich are additional information stored in the objects and heap elements that give \\nenough information to perform the mapping. Handles are often implemented to \\nbe opaque to the surrounding code, thereby maintaining an abstraction barrier be- \\ntween the application and the priority queue. For e xample, the handle within an \\napplication object might contain the corresponding index into the heap array. But \\nsince only the code for the priority queue accesses this index, the index is entirely \\nhidden from the application code. Because heap elements change locations within '),\n",

Conversely, each element in the h eap might contain a pointer \\nto the corresponding application object, but the he ap element knows this pointer \\nas only an opaque handle and the application maps t his handle to an application \\nobject. Typically, the worst-case overhead for maintaining handles is O.1/ per \\naccess. \\nAs an alternative to incorporating handles in appli cation objects, you can store \\nwithin the priority queue a mapping from application objects to array indices in the \\nheap. The advantage of doing so is that the mapping  is contained entirely within \\nthe priority queue, so that the application objects  need no further embellishment. \\nThe disadvantage lies in the additional cost of est ablishing and maintaining the \\nmapping. One option for the mapping is a hash table (see Chapter 11). 1 The added \\nexpected time for a hash table to map an object to an array index is just O.1/, \\nthough the worst-case time can be as bad as ‚.n/. \\nLet’s see how to implement the operations of a max-priority queue using a max- \\nheap. In the previous sections, we treated the arra y elements as the keys to be \\nsorted, implicitly assuming that any satellite data  moved with the corresponding \\nkeys. When a heap implements a priority queue, we i nstead treat each array ele- \\nment as a pointer to an object in the priority queue, so that the object is analogous \\nto the satellite data when sorting. We further assu me that each such object has an \\nattribute key, which determines where in the heap the object bel ongs. For a heap \\nimplemented by an array A, we refer to AŒi�: key. \\nThe procedure M AX -HEAP -MAXIMUM on the facing page implements the \\nMAXIMUM operation in ‚.1/ time, and MAX -HEAP -EXTRACT -MAX implements \\nthe operation E XTRACT -MAX. MAX -HEAP -EXTRACT -MAX is similar to the for \\nloop body (lines 335) of the HEAPSORT procedure. We implicitly assume that \\nMAX-HEAPIFY compares priority-queue objects based on their key attributes. We \\nalso assume that when M AX -HEAPIFY exchanges elements in the array, it is ex- \\nchanging pointers and also that it updates the mapp ing betwe en objects and ar- \\nray indices. The running time of M AX -HEAP -EXTRACT -MAX is O.lg n/, since \\nit performs only a constant amount of work on top o f the O.lg n/ time for \\nMAX-HEAPIFY , plus whatever overhead is incurred within M AX-HEAPIFY for \\nmapping priority-queue objects to array indices. \\nThe procedure M AX -HEAP -I NCREASE -KEY on page 176 implements the \\nI NCREASE -KEY operation. It ûrst veriûes that the new key k will not cause the \\nkey in the object x to decrease, and if there is no problem, it gives x the new key \\nvalue. The procedure then ûnds the index i in the array corresponding to object x , \\n1 In Python, dictionaries are implemented with hash tables. '),\n",

As M AX-HEAP - \\nI NCREASE -KEY traverses this path, it repeatedly compares an element’s key to \\nthat of its parent, exchanging pointers and continuing if the element’s key is larger, \\nand terminating if the element’s key is smaller, since the max-heap property now \\nholds. (See Exercise 6.5-7 for a precise loop invariant.) Like MAX -HEAPIFY when \\nused in a priority queue, M AX -HEAP -I NCREASE -KEY updates the information \\nthat maps objects to array indices when array eleme nts are exchanged. Figure 6.5 \\nshows an example of a M AX-HEAP -I NCREASE -KEY operation. In addition to \\nthe overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices, the running time \\nof MAX-HEAP -I NCREASE -KEY on an n-element heap is O.lg n/, since the path \\ntraced from the node updated in line 3 to the root has length O.lg n/. \\nThe procedure M AX -HEAP -I NSERT on the next page implements the I NSERT \\noperation.

Fredman and Tarjan [156] developed Fibonacci heaps, \\nwhich support I NSERT and D ECREASE -KEY in O.1/ amortized time (see Chap- \\nter 16). That is, the average worst-case running time for these operations is O.1/. \\nBrodal, Lagogiannis, and Tarjan [73] subsequently devised strict Fibonacci heaps, \\nwhich make these time bounds the actual running tim es.

Here is the three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting a sub- \\narray AŒp W r�: \\nDivide by partitioning (rearranging) the array AŒp W r� into two (possibly empty) \\nsubarrays AŒp W q \\ue003 1� (the low side) and AŒq C 1 W r� (the high side) such \\nthat each element in the low side of the partition is less than or equal to the \\npivot AŒq�, which is, in turn, less than or equal to each element in the high side. \\nCompute the index q of the pivot as part of this partitioning procedure. \\nConquer by calling quicksort recursively to sort each of the subarrays AŒp W q \\ue003 1� \\nand AŒq C 1 W r�. \\nCombine by doing nothing: because the two subarrays are already sorted, no work \\nis needed to combine them. All elements in AŒp W q \\ue003 1� are sorted and less than \\nor equal to AŒq�, and all elements in AŒq C 1 W r� are sorted and greater than or \\nequal to the pivot AŒq�. The entire subarray AŒp W r� cannot help but be sorted! \\nThe QUICKSORT  procedure implements quicksort. To sort an entire n-element \\narray AŒ1 W n�, the initial call is QUICKSORT .A;1;n/. \\nQUICKSORT .A;p;r/  \\n1 if p<r  \\n2 / / Partition the subarray around the pivot, which ends up in AŒq�. \\n3 q D PARTITION .A;p;r/  \\n4 QUICKSORT .A;p;q \\ue003 1/ / / recursively sort the low side \\n5 QUICKSORT .A;q C 1;r/ / / recursively sort the high side \\nPartitioning the array \\nThe key to the algorithm is the P ARTITION  procedure on the next page, which \\nrearranges the subarray AŒp W r� in place, returning the index of the dividing point  \\nbetween the two sides of the partition. \\nFigure 7.1 shows how PARTITION  works on an 8-element array. PARTITION  \\nalways selects the element x D AŒr� as the pivot. As the procedure runs, each \\nelement falls into exactly one of four regions, som e of which may be empty. At \\nthe start of each iteration of the for loop in lines 336, the regions satisfy certain \\nproperties, shown in Figure 7.2. We state these properties as a loop invariant: '),\n",

To allow you to gain some intu- \\nition before diving into a formal analysis, this section informally investigates how \\nquicksort performs under the assumptions of balanced versus unbalanced partition- \\ning. \\nBut ûrst, let’s brieüy look at the maximum amount of memory that quicksort re- \\nquires. Although quicksort sorts in place according  to the d eûnition on page 158, \\nthe amount of memory it uses4aside from the array being sorted4is not constant. \\nSince each recursive call requires a constant amount of space on the runtime stack, \\noutside of the array being sorted, quicksort requires space proportional to the max- \\nimum depth of the recursion.

(See Section 7.4.1.) \\nLet us assume that this unbalanced partitioning ari ses in each recursive call. The \\npartitioning costs ‚.n/ time.

(See Exercise 7.2-1.) \\nThus, if the partitioning is maximally unbalanced at every recursive level of the \\nalgorithm, the running time is ‚.n 2 /. The worst-case running time of quicksort is \\ntherefore no better than that of insertion sort.

For example, Exercise 7.2-6 asks you to show that about \\n80% of the time P ARTITION  produces a split that is at least as balanced as 9 to 1, \\nand about 20% of the time it produces a split that is less balanced than 9 to 1. \\nIn the average case, PARTITION  produces a mix of <good= and <bad= splits. In a \\nrecursion tree for an average-case execution of PARTITION , the good and bad splits \\nare distributed randomly throughout the tree. Suppose for the sake of intuition that \\nthe good and bad splits alternate levels in the tree, and that the good splits are best- \\ncase splits and the bad splits are worst-case splits. Figure 7.5(a) shows the splits \\nat two consecutive levels in the recursion tree. At the root of the tree, the cost is n \\nfor partitioning, and the subarrays produced have sizes n \\ue003 1 and 0: the worst case. \\nAt the next level, the subarray of size n \\ue003 1 undergoes best-case partitioning into \\nsubarrays of size .n \\ue003 1/=2 \\ue003 1 and .n \\ue003 1/=2. Let’s assume that the base-case cost \\nis 1 for the subarray of size 0. \\nThe combination of the bad split followed by the good split produces three sub- \\narrays of sizes 0, .n \\ue003 1/=2 \\ue003 1, and .n \\ue003 1/=2 at a combined partitioning cost of \\n‚.n/ C ‚.n \\ue003 1/ D ‚.n/. This situation is at most a constant factor worse  than \\nthat in Figure 7.5(b), namely, where a single level of partitioning produces two \\nsubarrays of size .n \\ue003 1/=2, at a cost of ‚.n/. Yet this latter situation is balanced! \\nIntuitively, the ‚.n \\ue003 1/ cost of the bad split in Figure 7.5(a) can be absorbed \\ninto the ‚.n/ cost of the good split, and the resulting split is good. Thus, the run- \\nning time of quicksort, when levels alternate betwe en good and bad splits, is like \\nthe running time for good splits alone: still O.n lg n/, but with a slightly larger \\nconstant hidden by the O-notation.

Even if we add a few new levels with the most un- \\nbalanced split possible between these levels, the total time remains O.n lg n/. We \\ncan analyze the expected running time of R ANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  precisely \\nby ûrst understanding how the partitioning procedure operates and then using this \\nunderstanding to derive an O.n lg n/ bound on the expected running time. This \\nupper bound on the expected running time, combined with the ‚.n lg n/ best-case \\nbound we saw in Section 7.2, yields a ‚.n lg n/ expected running time. We assume \\nthroughout that the values of the elements being sorted are distinct. \\nRunning time and comparisons \\nThe QUICKSORT  and RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  procedures differ only in how \\nthey select pivot elements. They are the same in al l other respects. We can there- \\nfore analyze R ANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  by considering the QUICKSORT  and \\nPARTITION  procedures, but with the assumption that pivot elem ents are selected \\nrandomly from the subarray passed to R ANDOMIZED -PARTITION . Let’s start by \\nrelating the asymptotic running time of QUICKSORT  to the number of times ele- \\nments are compared (all in line 4 of PARTITION ), understanding that this analysis \\nalso applies to RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT . Note that we are counting the number \\nof times that array elements are compared, not comparisons of indices. \\nLemma 7.1 \\nThe running time of QUICKSORT  on an n-element array is O.n C X/, where X is \\nthe number of element comparisons performed.

Each time P ARTITION  is called, it selects a pivot ele- \\nment, which is never included in any future recursi ve calls t o QUICKSORT  and \\nPARTITION . Thus, there can be at most n calls to PARTITION  over the entire ex- \\necution of the quicksort algorithm. Each time QUICKSORT  calls PARTITION , it \\nalso recursively calls itself twice, so there are at most 2n calls to the QUICKSORT  \\nprocedure itself. \\nOne call to PARTITION  takes O.1/ time plus an amount of time that is propor- \\ntional to the number of iterations of the for loop in lines 336. Each iteration of this \\nfor loop performs one comparison in line 4, comparing the pivot element to an- \\nother element of the array A. Therefore, the total time spent in the for loop across \\nall executions is proportional to X . Since there are at most n calls to PARTITION  \\nand the time spent outside the for loop is O.1/ for each call, the total time spent \\nin PARTITION  outside of the for loop is O.n/. Thus the total time for quicksort is \\nO.n C X/. \\nOur goal for analyzing RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT , therefore, is to compute \\nthe expected value E ŒX� of the random variable X denoting the total number of \\ncomparisons performed in all calls to P ARTITION . To do so, we must understand \\nwhen the quicksort algorithm compares two elements of the array and when it does \\nnot. For ease of analysis, let’s index the elements of the array A by their position \\nin the sorted output, rather than their position in  the input. That is, although the \\nelements in A may start out in any order, we’ll refer to them by ´ 1 ;´ 2 ;:::;´  n , \\nwhere ´ 1 < ´ 2 < \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 < ´ n , with strict inequality because we assume that all  \\nelements are distinct. We denote the set f´ i ;´ i C1 ;:::;´  j g by Z ij . \\nThe next lemma characterizes when two elements are compared. \\nLemma 7.2 \\nDuring the execution of RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  on an array of n distinct ele- \\nments ´ 1 <´ 2 < \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 <´ n , an element ´ i is compared with an element ´ j , where \\ni <j , if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot b efore any other element in \\nthe set Z ij . Moreover, no two elements are ever compared twice. \\nProof Let’s look at the ûrst time that an element x 2 Z ij is chosen as a pivot \\nduring the execution of the algorithm. There are th ree cases to consider. If x is \\nneither ´ i nor ´ j 4that is, ´ i <x <´ j 4then ´ i and ´ j are not compared at any \\nsubsequent time, because they fall into different s ides of the partition around x . \\nIf x D ´ i , then PARTITION  compares ´ i with every other item in Z ij . Similarly, \\nif x D ´ j , then P ARTITION  compares ´ j with every other item in Z ij . Thus, \\n´ i and ´ j are compared if and only if the ûrst element to be chosen as a pivot \\nfrom Z ij is either ´ i or ´ j . In the latter two cases, where one of ´ i and ´ j is chosen '),\n",

Suppose that the ûrst pivot element is 7. Then \\nthe ûrst call to PARTITION  separates the numbers into two sets: f1;2;3;4;5;6 g and \\nf8;9;10g. In the process, the pivot element 7 is compared with all other elements, \\nbut no number from the ûrst set (e.g., 2) is or ever will be compared with any \\nnumber from the second set (e.g., 9). The values 7 and 9 are compared because 7 \\nis the ûrst item from Z 7;9 to be chosen as a pivot. In contrast, 2 and 9 are never \\ncompared because the ûrst pivot element chosen from Z 2;9 is 7. \\nThe next lemma gives the probability that two elements are compared. \\nLemma 7.3 \\nConsider an execution of the procedure R ANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  on an array \\nof n distinct elements ´ 1 <´ 2 < \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 <´ n . Given two arbitrary elements ´ i and ´ j \\nwhere i <j , the probability that they are compared is 2=.j \\ue003 i C 1/. \\nProof Let’s look at the tree of recursive calls that RANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  \\nmakes, and consider the sets of elements provided as input to each call. Initially, the \\nroot set contains all the elements of Z ij , since the root set contains every element \\nin A. The elements belonging to Z ij all stay together for each recursive call of \\nRANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  until PARTITION  chooses some element x 2 Z ij as a \\npivot. From that point on, the pivot x appears in no subsequent input set. The ûrst \\ntime that R ANDOMIZED -SELECT chooses a pivot x 2 Z ij from a set containing \\nall the elements of Z ij , each element in Z ij is equally likely to be x because the \\npivot is chosen uniformly at random. Since jZ ij j D j \\ue003 i C 1, the probability is \\n1=.j \\ue003 i C 1/ that any given element in Z ij is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij . Thus, \\nby Lemma 7.2, we have \\nPr f´ i is compared with ´ j g D  Pr f´ i or ´ j is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g \\nD Pr f´ i is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g \\nC Pr f´ j is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g \\nD 2 \\nj \\ue003 i C 1 ; \\nwhere the second line follows from the ûrst because the two events are mutually \\nexclusive. \\nWe can now complete the analysis of randomized quicksort.

Going right from the node labeled \\n2:3 indicates that a 2 >a 3 . Going right from the node labeled 1:3 indicates that a 1 >a 3 . Therefore, \\nwe have the ordering a 3 හ a 1 හ a 2 , as indicated in the leaf labeled h3;1;2i. Because the three input \\nelements have 3Š D 6 possible permutations, the decision tree must have at least 6 leaves. \\ncomparisons of the form a i D a j are useless, which means that we can assume \\nthat no comparisons for exact equality occur. Moreover, the comparisons a i හ a j , \\na i \\ue004 a j , a i > a j , and a i < a j are all equivalent in that they yield identical \\ninformation about the relative order of a i and a j . We therefore assume that all \\ncomparisons have the form a i හ a j . \\nThe decision-tree model \\nWe can view comparison sorts abstractly in terms of  decision trees. A decision \\ntree is a full binary tree (each node is either a leaf or has both children) that repre- \\nsents the comparisons between elements that are performed by a particular sorting \\nalgorithm operating on an input of a given size.

(See Sec- \\ntion C.1 for background on permutations.) Indices in the internal nodes and the \\nleaves always refer to the original positions of the array elements at the start of the \\nsorting algorithm.

Because any correct sort- \\ning algorithm must be able to produce each permutation of its input, each of the nŠ \\npermutations on n elements must appear as at least one of the leaves of the decision \\ntree for a comparison sort to be correct. Furthermore, each of these leaves must be \\nreachable from the root by a downward path corresponding to an actual execution \\nof the comparison sort.

Consequently , the worst-case number of \\ncomparisons for a given comparison sort algorithm equals the height of its decision \\ntree. A lower bound on the heights of all decision trees in which each permutation \\nappears as a reachable leaf is therefore a lower bo und on the running time of any \\ncomparison sort algorithm. The following theorem establishes such a lower bound. \\nTheorem 8.1 \\nAny comparison sort algorithm requires �.n lg n/ comparisons in the worst case. \\nProof From the preceding discussion, it sufûces to determine the height of a \\ndecision tree in which each permutation appears as a reachable leaf. Consider \\na decision tree of height h with l reachable leaves corresponding to a comparison \\nsort on n elements.

An operator can then \\ngather the cards bin by bin, so that cards with the ûrst place punched are on top of \\ncards with the second place punched, and so on. \\nFor decimal digits, each column uses only 10 places. (The other two places are \\nreserved for encoding nonnumeric characters.) A d -digit number occupies a ûeld \\nof d columns. Since the card sorter can look at only one  column at a time, the \\nproblem of sorting n cards on a d -digit number requires a sorting algorithm. \\nIntuitively, you might sort numbers on their most signiﬁcant (leftmost) digit, \\nsort each of the resulting bins recursively, and th en combine the decks in order. \\nUnfortunately, since the cards in 9 of the 10 bins must be put aside to sort each of \\nthe bins, this procedure generates many intermediate piles of cards that you would \\nhave to keep track of. (See Exercise 8.3-6.) \\nRadix sort solves the problem of card sorting4counterintuitively4by sorting on \\nthe least signiﬁcant digit ûrst. The algorithm then combines the cards into a single \\ndeck, with the cards in the 0 bin preceding the cards in the 1 bin preceding the \\ncards in the 2 bin, and so on. Then it sorts the entire deck again on the second-least \\nsigniûcant digit and recombines the deck in a like manner. The process continues \\nuntil the cards have been sorted on all d digits. Remarkably, at that point the cards \\nare fully sorted on the d -digit number. Thus, only d passes through the deck are \\nrequired to sort.

Alternatively, we could sort the inf ormation three times with a \\nstable sort: ûrst on day (the <least signiûcant= part), next on month, and ûnally on \\nyear. \\nThe code for radix sort is straightforward.

The analysis of the running time depends on the stable \\nsort used as the intermediate sorting algorithm. When each digit lies in the range 0 \\nto k \\ue003 1 (so that it can take on k possible values), and k is not too large, counting \\nsort is the obvious choice. Each pass over nd -digit numbers then takes ‚.n C k/ \\ntime. There are d passes, and so the total time for radix sort is ‚.d.n C k//. \\nWhen d is constant and k D O.n/, we can make radix sort run in linear time. \\nMore generally, we have some üexibility in how to break each key into digits. \\nLemma 8.4 \\nGiven nb-bit numbers and any positive integer r හ b, RADIX -SORT correctly sorts \\nthese numbers in ‚..b=r/.n C 2 r // time if the stable sort it uses takes ‚.n C k/ \\ntime for inputs in the range 0 to k.

Each digit is an integer in the range 0 to 2 r \\ue003 1, so that we can use counting \\nsort with k D 2 r \\ue003 1.

If b< blg nc, then r හ b implies .nC2 r / D ‚.n/. \\nThus, choosing r D b yields a running time of .b=b/.n C 2 b / D ‚.n/, which is \\nasymptotically optimal. If b \\ue004 b lg nc, then choosing r D b lg nc gives the best \\nrunning time to within a constant factor, which we can see as follows. 1 Choosing \\nr D blg nc yields a running time of ‚.bn= lg n/. As r increases above blg nc, the \\n2 r term in the numerator increases faster than the r term in the denominator, and so \\nincreasing r above blg nc yields a running time of �.bn= lg n/. If instead r were \\nto decrease below blg nc, then the b=r term increases and the n C 2 r term remains \\nat ‚.n/. \\nIs radix sort preferable to a comparison-based sorting algorithm, such as quick- \\nsort?

According to Knuth, the ûrst published refer- \\nence to the method is a 1929 document by L. J. Comrie describing punched-card \\nequipment. Bucket sorting has been in use since 1956, when the basic idea was \\nproposed by Isaac and Singleton [235]. \\nMunro and Raman [338] give a stable sorting algorithm that performs O.n 1C\\ue001 / \\ncomparisons in the worst case, where 0<�  හ 1 is any ûxed constant. Although \\nany of the O.n lg n/-time algorithms make fewer comparisons, the algorithm by \\nMunro and Raman moves data only O.n/ times and operates in place. \\nThe case of sorting n b-bit integers in o.n lg n/ time has been considered by \\nmany researchers. Several positive results have been obtained, each under slightly \\ndifferent assumptions about the model of computatio n and the restrictions placed \\non the algorithm. All the results assume that the computer memory is divided into \\naddressable b-bit words. Fredman and Willard [157] introduced the fusion tree data \\nstructure and used it to sort n integers in O.n lg n= lg lg n/ time. This bound was \\nlater improved to O.n \\np \\nlg n/ time by Andersson [17]. These algorithms require \\nthe use of multiplication and several precomputed constants. Andersson, Hagerup, \\nNilsson, and Raman [18] have shown how to sort n integers in O.n lg lg n/ time \\nwithout using multiplication, but their method requ ires st orage that can be un- \\nbounded in terms of n. Using multiplicative hashing, we can reduce the s torage \\nneeded to O.n/, but then the O.n lg lg n/ worst-case bound on the running time \\nbecomes an expected-time bound. Generalizing the exponential search trees of \\nAndersson [17], Thorup [434] gave an O.n.lg lg n/ 2 /-time sorting algorithm that \\ndoes not use multiplication or randomization, and it uses linear space. Combining \\nthese techniques with some new ideas, Han [207] improved the bound for sorting \\nto O.n lg lg n lg lg lg n/ time.

For \\nexample, the minimum of a set of elements is the ûrst order statistic (i D 1), \\nand the maximum is the nth order statistic ( i D n). A median, informally, is \\nthe <halfway point= of the set. When n is odd, the median is unique, occurring at \\ni D .n C1/=2. When n is even, there are two medians, the lower median occurring \\nat i D n=2 and the upper median occurring at i D n=2 C 1. Thus, regardless of \\nthe parity of n, medians occur at i D b .n C 1/=2c and i D d .n C 1/=2e. For \\nsimplicity in this text, however, we consistently u se the phrase <the median= to \\nrefer to the lower median. \\nThis chapter addresses the problem of selecting the  i th order statistic from a \\nset of n distinct numbers. We assume for convenience that th e set con tains dis- \\ntinct numbers, although virtually everything that we do extends to the situation in \\nwhich a set contains repeated values.

To obtain an upper bound of n \\ue003 1 comparisons, just examine each \\nelement of the set in turn and keep track of the sm allest element seen so far.

Yes, because it turns out that \\nthere’s a lower bound of n \\ue003 1 comparisons for the problem of determining the \\nminimum. Think of any algorithm that determines the  minimum as a tournament \\namong the elements. Each comparison is a match in t he tournament in which the \\nsmaller of the two elements wins. Since every eleme nt except the winner must \\nlose at least one match, we can conclude that n \\ue003 1 comparisons are necessary to \\ndetermine the minimum. Hence the algorithm M INIMUM is optimal with respect \\nto the number of comparisons performed. \\nSimultaneous minimum and maximum \\nSome applications need to ûnd both the minimum and the maximum of a set of n \\nelements. For example, a graphics program may need to scale a set of .x;y/ data \\nto ût onto a rectangular display screen or other graphical output device. To do \\nso, the program must ûrst determine the minimum and maximum value of each \\ncoordinate. \\nOf course, we can determine both the minimum and the maximum of n ele- \\nments using ‚.n/ comparisons. We simply ûnd the minimum and maximum in- \\ndependently, using n \\ue003 1 comparisons for each, for a total of 2n \\ue003 2 D ‚.n/ \\ncomparisons. '),\n",

We can ûnd both the minimum and the maximum using at \\nmost 3 bn=2c comparisons. The trick is to maintain both the mini mum and maxi- \\nmum elements seen thus far. Rather than processing each element of the input by \\ncomparing it against the current minimum and maximu m, at a cost of 2 compar- \\nisons per element, process elements in pairs. Compa re pairs of elements from the \\ninput ûrst with each other, and then compare the smaller with the current mini- \\nmum and the larger to the current maximum, at a cos t of 3 comparisons for every \\n2 elements. \\nHow you set up initial values for the current minim um and maximum depends \\non whether n is odd or even. If n is odd, set both the minimum and maximum to \\nthe value of the ûrst element, and then process the rest of the elements in pairs. \\nIf n is even, perform 1 comparison on the ûrst 2 elements to determine the initial \\nvalues of the minimum and maximum, and then process the rest of the elements in \\npairs as in the case for odd n. \\nLet’s count the total number of comparisons.

We’ll see that the al- \\ngorithm has a linear expected running time, however, and because it is randomized, \\nno particular input elicits the worst-case behavior. \\nTo see the intuition behind the linear expected run ning time, suppose that each \\ntime the algorithm randomly selects a pivot element , the pivot lies somewhere \\nwithin the second and third quartiles4the <middle half=4of the remaining ele- \\nments in sorted order. If the i th smallest element is less than the pivot, then al l \\nthe elements greater than the pivot are ignored in all future recursive calls. These \\nignored elements include at least the uppermost quartile, and possibly more. Like- \\nwise, if the i th smallest element is greater than the pivot, then  all the elements \\nless than the pivot4at least the ûrst quartile4are ignored in all future recursive \\ncalls. Either way, therefore, at least 1=4 of the remaining elements are ignored in \\nall future recursive calls, leaving at most 3=4 of the remaining elements in play: \\nresiding in the subarray AŒp W r�. Since R ANDOMIZED -PARTITION  takes ‚.n/ \\ntime on a subarray of n elements, the recurrence for the worst-case running time \\nis T.n/ D T.3n=4/ C ‚.n/. By case 3 of the master method (Theorem 4.1 on \\npage 102), this recurrence has solution T.n/ D ‚.n/. \\nOf course, the pivot does not necessarily fall into the middle half every time. \\nSince the pivot is selected at random, the probabil ity that it falls into the middle \\nhalf is about 1=2 each time. We can view the process of selecting the  pivot as a \\nBernoulli trial (see Section C.4) with success equating to the pivot residing in the \\nmiddle half. Thus the expected number of trials nee ded for success is given by a \\ngeometric distribution: just two trials on average (equation (C.36) on page 1197). \\nIn other words, we expect that half of the partitio nings reduce the number of ele- \\nments still in play by at least 3=4 and that half of the partitionings do not help as \\nmuch. Consequently, the expected number of partitio nings at most doubles from \\nthe case when the pivot always falls into the middl e half. The cost of each extra \\npartitioning is less than the one that preceded it, so that the expected running time \\nis still ‚.n/. \\nTo make the above argument rigorous, we start by deûning the random vari- \\nable A .j / as the set of elements of A that are still in play after j partitionings (that \\nis, within the subarray AŒp W r� after j calls of R ANDOMIZED -SELECT ), so that \\nA .0/ consists of all the elements in A. Since each partitioning removes at least \\none element4the pivot4from being in play, the sequence jA .0/ j; jA .1/ j; jA .2/ j;:::  \\nstrictly decreases. Set A .j \\ue0021/ is in play before the j th partitioning, and set A .j / \\nremains in play afterward. For convenience, assume that the initial set A .0/ is the \\nresult of a 0th <dummy= partitioning. \\nLet’s call the j th partitioning helpful if jA .j / j හ  .3=4/jA .j \\ue0021/ j. Figure 9.1 \\nshows the sets A .j / and whether partitionings are helpful for an exampl e array. \\nA helpful partitioning corresponds to a successful Bernoulli trial. The following \\nlemma shows that a partitioning is at least as likely to be helpful as not. '),\n",

Let’s more pre- \\ncisely deûne the middle half of an n-element subarray as all but the smallest \\ndn=4e \\ue003 1 and greatest dn=4e \\ue003 1 elements (that is, all but the ûrst dn=4e \\ue003 1 \\nand last dn=4e \\ue003 1 elements if the subarray were sorted). We’ll prove that if the \\npivot falls into the middle half, then the pivot le ads to a helpful partitioning, and \\nwe’ll also prove that the probability of the pivot falling into the middle half is at \\nleast 1=2. \\nRegardless of where the pivot falls, either all the  elements greater than it or all \\nthe elements less than it, along with the pivot itself, will no longer be in play after \\npartitioning. If the pivot falls into the middle ha lf, therefore, at least dn=4e \\ue003 1 \\nelements less than the pivot or dn=4e \\ue003 1 elements greater than the pivot, plus \\nthe pivot, will no longer be in play after partitio ning. That is, at least dn=4e ele- \\nments will no longer be in play. The number of elem ents remaining in play will \\nbe at most n \\ue003 dn=4e, which equals b3n=4c by Exercise 3.3-2 on page 70. Since \\nb3n=4c හ 3n=4, the partitioning is helpful. \\nTo determine a lower bound on the probability that a randomly chosen pivot falls \\ninto the middle half, we determine an upper bound o n the probability that it does \\nnot.

By this deûnition, T.n/ \\nis monotonically increasing. \\nWe ûrst determine an upper bound on the time spent outside the recursive calls \\nin lines 16, 23, and 24. The while loop in lines 1310 executes 0 to 4 times, \\nwhich is O.1/ times. Since the dominant time within the loop is t he computa- \\ntion of the minimum in lines 234, which takes ‚.n/ time, lines 1310 execute in \\nO.1/ \\ue001 ‚.n/ D O.n/ time. The sorting of the 5-element groups in lines 12313 \\ntakes ‚.n/ time because each 5-element group takes ‚.1/ time to sort (even using \\nan asymptotically inefûcient sorting algorithm such as insertion sort), and there are \\ng elements to sort, where n=5 \\ue003 1 < g හ n=5. Finally, the time to partition in \\nline 17 is ‚.n/, as Exercise 7.1-3 on page 187 asks you to show. Because the re- \\nmaining bookkeeping only costs ‚.1/ time, the total amount of time spent outside \\nof the recursive calls is O.n/ C ‚.n/ C ‚.n/ C ‚.1/ D ‚.n/. \\nNow let’s determine the running time for the recursive calls. The recursive call \\nto ûnd the pivot in line 16 takes T.g/ හ T.n=5/ time, since g හ n=5 and T.n/ \\nmonotonically increases. Of the two recursive calls in lines 23 and 24, at most \\none is executed. But we’ll see that no matter which of these two recursive calls \\nto S ELECT actually executes, the number of elements in the re cursive call turns \\nout to be at most 7n=10, and hence the worst-case cost for lines 23 and 24 is at \\nmost T.7n=10/. Let’s now show that the machinations with group medians and the \\nchoice of the pivot x as the median of the group medians guarantees this property. '),\n",

There are g හ n=5 groups of 5 el- \\nements, with each group shown as a column sorted from bottom to top. The arrows \\nshow the ordering of elements within the columns. T he columns are ordered from \\nleft to right with groups to the left of x ’s group having a group median less than x \\nand those to the right of x ’s group having a group median greater than x . Although \\nthe relative order within each group matters, the relative order among groups to the \\nleft of x ’s column doesn’t really matter, and neither does the relative order among \\ngroups to the right of x ’s column. The important thing is that the groups to the \\nleft have group medians less than x (shown by the horizontal arrows entering x ), \\nand that the groups to the right have group medians  greater than x (shown by the \\nhorizontal arrows leaving x ). Thus, the yellow region contains elements that w e \\nknow are greater than or equal to x , and the blue region contains elements that we \\nknow are less than or equal to x . \\nThese two regions each contain at least 3g=2 elements. The number of group \\nmedians in the yellow region is bg=2c C 1, and for each group median, two ad- \\nditional elements are greater than it, making a tot al of 3.bg=2c C 1/ \\ue004 3g=2 \\nelements. Similarly, the number of group medians in the blue region is dg=2e, and \\nfor each group median, two additional elements are less than it, making a total of \\n3 dg=2e \\ue004 3g=2. \\nThe elements in the yellow region cannot fall into the low side of the partition \\naround x , and those in the blue region cannot fall into the high side. The elements \\nin neither region4those lying on a white background4could fall into either side \\nof the partition. But since the low side of the partition excludes the elements in the \\nyellow region, and there are a total of 5g elements, we know that the low side of \\nthe partition can contain at most 5g \\ue003 3g=2 D 7g=2 හ 7n=10 elements. Likewise, \\nthe high side of the partition excludes the elements in the blue region, and a similar \\ncalculation shows that it also contains at most 7n=10 elements. \\nAll of which leads to the following recurrence for the worst-case running time \\nof SELECT : \\nT.n/ හ T.n=5/ C T.7n=10/ C ‚.n/: (9.1) \\nWe can show that T.n/ D O.n/ by substitution. 2 More speciûcally, we’ll prove \\nthat T.n/ හ cn for some suitably large constant c>0  and all n>0 . Substituting \\nthis inductive hypothesis into the right-hand side of recurrence (9.1) and assuming \\nthat n \\ue004 5 yields \\n2 We could also use the Akra-Bazzi method from Section 4.7, which involves calculus, to solve this \\nrecurrence.

Whereas \\nmathematical sets are unchanging, the sets manipula ted by algorithms can grow, \\nshrink, or otherwise change over time. We call such  sets dynamic. The next four \\nchapters present some basic techniques for representing ûnite dynamic sets and \\nmanipulating them on a computer. \\nAlgorithms may require several types of operations to be performed on sets. For \\nexample, many algorithms need only the ability to i nsert elements into, delete el- \\nements from, and test membership in a set. We call a dynamic set that supports \\nthese operations a dictionary. Other algorithms require more complicated opera- \\ntions. For example, min-priority queues, which Chapter 6 introduced in the context \\nof the heap data structure, support the operations of inserting an element into and \\nextracting the smallest element from a set. The bes t way to implement a dynamic \\nset depends upon the operations that you need to support. \\nElements of a dynamic set \\nIn a typical implementation of a dynamic set, each element is represented by an \\nobject whose attributes can be examined and manipul ated given a pointer to the \\nobject. Some kinds of dynamic sets assume that one of the obje ct’s attributes is \\nan identifying key. If the keys are all different, we can think of th e dynamic set as \\nbeing a set of key values. The object may contain satellite data, which are carried \\naround in other object attributes but are otherwise  unused b y the set implementa- \\ntion. It may also have attributes that are manipula ted by the set operations. These \\nattributes may contain data or pointers to other objects in the set. \\nSome dynamic sets presuppose that the keys are draw n from a totally ordered \\nset, such as the real numbers, or the set of all wo rds under the usual alphabetic '),\n",

A total ordering allows us to deûne the minimum element of the set, for \\nexample, or to speak of the next element larger than a given element in a set. \\nOperations on dynamic sets \\nOperations on a dynamic set can be grouped into two categories: queries, which \\nsimply return information about the set, and modifying operations, which change \\nthe set. Here is a list of typical operations. Any speciûc application will usually \\nrequire only a few of these to be implemented. \\nSEARCH .S;k/ \\nA query that, given a set S and a key value k, returns a pointer x to an element \\nin S such that x: key D k, or NIL if no such element belongs to S . \\nI NSERT .S;x/ \\nA modifying operation that adds the element pointed  to by x to the set S . We \\nusually assume that any attributes in element x needed by the set implementa- \\ntion have already been initialized. \\nDELETE .S;x/ \\nA modifying operation that, given a pointer x to an element in the set S , re- \\nmoves x from S . (Note that this operation takes a pointer to an e lement x , not \\na key value.) \\nMINIMUM .S/ and MAXIMUM .S/ \\nQueries on a totally ordered set S that return a pointer to the element of S with \\nthe smallest (for MINIMUM ) or largest (for MAXIMUM ) key. \\nSUCCESSOR .S;x/ \\nA query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S , \\nreturns a pointer to the next larger element in S , or NIL if x is the maximum \\nelement. \\nPREDECESSOR  .S;x/ \\nA query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S , \\nreturns a pointer to the next smaller element in S , or NIL if x is the minimum \\nelement. \\nIn some situations, we can extend the queries S UCCESSOR  and P REDECESSOR  \\nso that they apply to sets with nondistinct keys. F or a set on n keys, the normal \\npresumption is that a call to M INIMUM followed by n \\ue003 1 calls to S UCCESSOR  \\nenumerates the elements in the set in sorted order. \\nWe usually measure the time taken to execute a set operation in terms of the size \\nof the set. For example, Chapter 13 describes a data structure that can support any \\nof the operations listed above on a set of size n in O.lg n/ time. '),\n",

The downside, however, is that many of these operations have a worst- \\ncase running time of ‚.n/. If the array is not sorted, I NSERT and D ELETE can \\ntake ‚.1/ time, but the remaining operations take ‚.n/ time. If instead the ar- \\nray is maintained in sorted order, then M INIMUM , MAXIMUM , SUCCESSOR , and \\nPREDECESSOR  take ‚.1/ time; SEARCH takes O.lg n/ time if implemented with \\nbinary search; but I NSERT and DELETE take ‚.n/ time in the worst case. The data \\nstructures studied in this part improve on the array implementation for many of the \\ndynamic-set operations. \\nOverview of Part III \\nChapters 10313 describe several data structures that we can use to implement dy- \\nnamic sets. We’ll use many of these data structures later to construct efûcient algo- \\nrithms for a variety of problems. We already saw another important data structure \\n4the heap4in Chapter 6. \\nChapter 10 presents the essentials of working with simple data structures such \\nas arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees. If you have taken \\nan introductory programming course, then much of this material should be familiar \\nto you. \\nChapter 11 introduces hash tables, a widely used data structure supporting the \\ndictionary operations I NSERT , DELETE , and S EARCH . In the worst case, hash ta- \\nbles require ‚.n/ time to perform a S EARCH operation, but the expected time for \\nhash-table operations is O.1/. We rely on probability to analyze hash-table opera- \\ntions, but you can understand how the operations work even without probability. \\nBinary search trees, which are covered in Chapter 12, support all the dynamic- \\nset operations listed above. In the worst case, eac h operation takes ‚.n/ time on \\na tree with n elements. Binary search trees serve as the basis fo r many other data \\nstructures. \\nChapter 13 introduces red-black trees, which are a variant of binary search trees. \\nUnlike ordinary binary search trees, red-black trees are guaranteed to perform well: \\noperations take O.lg n/ time in the worst case. A red-black tree is a balanced search \\ntree. Chapter 18 in Part V presents another kind of balanced search tree, called a \\nB-tree. Although the mechanics of red-black trees are somewhat intricate, you can \\nglean most of their properties from the chapter wit hout studying the mechanics \\nin detail. Nevertheless, you probably will ûnd walking through the code to be \\ninstructive. '),\n",

Although you can construct  many complex data structures \\nusing pointers, we present only the rudimentary one s: arrays, matrices, stacks, \\nqueues, linked lists, and rooted trees. \\n10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues \\n10.1.1 Arrays \\nWe assume that, as in most programming languages, a n array is stored as a con- \\ntiguous sequence of bytes in memory. If the ûrst element of an array has index s \\n(for example, in an array with 1-origin indexing, s D 1), the array starts at memory \\naddress a, and each array element occupies b bytes, then the i th element occupies \\nbytes a C b.i \\ue003 s/ through a C b.i \\ue003 s C 1/ \\ue003 1. Since most of the arrays in this book \\nare indexed starting at 1, and a few starting at 0, we can simplify these formulas a \\nlittle. When s D 1, the i th element occupies bytes a C b.i \\ue003 1/ through a C bi \\ue003 1, \\nand when s D 0, the i th element occupies bytes a C bi through a C b.i C 1/ \\ue003 1. \\nAssuming that the computer can access all memory lo cations in the same amount \\nof time (as in the RAM model described in Section 2 .2), it takes constant time to \\naccess any array element, regardless of the index. \\nMost programming languages require each element of a particular array to be \\nthe same size. If the elements of a given array mig ht occupy different numbers \\nof bytes, then the above formulas fail to apply, si nce the element size b is not a \\nconstant. In such cases, the array elements are usu ally objects of varying sizes, \\nand what actually appears in each array element is a pointer to the object. The \\nnumber of bytes occupied by a pointer is typically the same, no matter what the \\npointer references, so that to access an object in an array, the above formulas give \\nthe address of the pointer to the object and then t he pointer must be followed to \\naccess the object itself.

The two most common ways to sto re a matri x are row-major \\nand column-major order. Let’s consider an m\\ue005n matrix4a matrix with m rows and \\nn columns. In row-major order, the matrix is stored row by row, and in column- \\nmajor order, the matrix is stored column by column. For exampl e, consider the \\n2 \\ue005 3 matrix \\nM D \\nÏ 1 2 3 \\n4 5 6 \\nÐ \\n: (10.1) \\nRow-major order stores the two rows 1 2 3 and 4 5 6, whereas column-major \\norder stores the three columns 1 4; 2 5; and 3 6. \\nParts (a) and (b) of Figure 10.1 show how to store this matrix using a single \\none-dimensional array. It’s stored in row-major order in part (a) and in column- \\nmajor order in part (b). If the rows, columns, and the single array all are indexed \\nstarting at s , then MŒi;j� 4the element in row i and column j 4is at array in- \\ndex s C .n.i \\ue003 s// C .j \\ue003 s/ with row-major order and s C .m.j \\ue003 s// C .i \\ue003 s/ \\nwith column-major order. When s D 1, the single-array indices are n.i \\ue003 1/ C j \\nwith row-major order and i C m.j \\ue003 1/ with column-major order. When s D 0, \\nthe single-array indices are simpler: ni C j with row-major order and i C mj \\nwith column-major order. For the example matrix M with 1-origin indexing, ele- \\nment MŒ2;1� is stored at index 3.2 \\ue0031/ C1 D 4 in the single array using row-major \\norder and at index 2 C 2.1 \\ue003 1/ D 2 using column-major order. \\nParts (c) and (d) of Figure 10.1 show multiple-array strategies for storing the \\nexample matrix.

Matrix element MŒi;j�  is stored in array \\nelement AŒj�Œi�. \\nSingle-array representations are typically more efûcient on modern machines \\nthan multiple-array representations. But multiple-array representations can some- \\ntimes be more üexible, for example, allowing for <ragged arrays,= in which the \\nrows in the row-major version may have different lengths, or symmetrically for the \\ncolumn-major version, where columns may have different lengths. \\nOccasionally, other schemes are used to store matrices. In the block representa- \\ntion, the matrix is divided into blocks, and each block  is stored contiguously. For \\nexample, a 4 \\ue005 4 matrix that is divided into 2 \\ue005 2 blocks, such as \\n\\ue001 1 2  3 4  \\n5 6  7 8  \\n9 10 11 12 \\n13 14 15 16 \\n˘ \\nmight be stored in a single array in the order h1;2;5;6;3;4;7;8;9;10;13;14;11;  \\n12;15;16i. \\n10.1.3 Stacks and queues \\nStacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the ele ment removed from the set \\nby the D ELETE operation is prespeciûed. In a stack, the element deleted from \\nthe set is the one most recently inserted: the stac k implements a last-in, ûrst-out, \\nor LIFO, policy. Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that \\nhas been in the set for the longest time: the queue  implements a ûrst-in, ûrst-out, \\nor FIFO, policy. There are several efûcient ways to implement stacks and queues \\non a computer. Here, you will see how to use an array with attributes to store them. \\nStacks \\nThe I NSERT operation on a stack is often called P USH , and the D ELETE opera- \\ntion, which does not take an element argument, is o ften called P OP. These names \\nare allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used \\nin cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped  from the stack is the reverse \\nof the order in which they were pushed onto the sta ck, since only the top plate is \\naccessible. \\nFigure 10.2 shows how to implement a stack of at most n elements with an \\narray SŒ1 W n�. The stack has attributes S: top, indexing the most recently inserted \\nelement, and S: size, equaling the size n of the array. The stack consists of elements \\nSŒ1 W S: top�, where SŒ1� is the element at the bottom of the stack and SŒS: top� is \\nthe element at the top. '),\n",

The queue has a head and a tail. When an element is \\nenqueued, it takes its place at the tail of the que ue, just as a newly arriving cus- \\ntomer takes a place at the end of the line. The element dequeued is always the one \\nat the head of the queue, like the customer at the head of the line, who has waited \\nthe longest. \\nFigure 10.3 shows one way to implement a queue of at most n \\ue003 1 elements \\nusing an array QŒ1 W n�, with the attribute Q: size equaling the size n of the array. \\nThe queue has an attribute Q: head that indexes, or points to, its head.

If x: prev D NIL , \\nthe element x has no predecessor and is therefore the ûrst element, or head, of \\nthe list. If x: next D NIL , the element x has no successor and is therefore the last \\nelement, or tail, of the list. An attribute L: head points to the ûrst element of the \\nlist. If L: head D NIL , the list is empty. \\nA list may have one of several forms. It may be eit her singly linked or doubly \\nlinked, it may be sorted or not, and it may be circ ular or not. If a list is singly \\nlinked, each element has a next pointer but not a prev pointer. If a list is sorted, the \\nlinear order of the list corresponds to the linear order of keys stored in elements \\nof the list. The minimum element is then the head o f the list, and the maximum \\nelement is the tail. If the list is unsorted, the elements can appear in any order. In \\na circular list, the prev pointer of the head of the list points to the tail, and the next \\npointer of the tail of the list points to the head. You can think of a circular list as a \\nring of elements. In the remainder of this section,  we assume that the lists we are \\nworking with are unsorted and doubly linked. '),\n",

In this section, we look speciûcally at the problem of representing rooted \\ntrees by linked data structures. We ûrst look at binary trees, and then we present a \\nmethod for rooted trees in which nodes can have an arbitrary number of children. \\nWe represent each node of a tree by an object. As w ith linked lists, we assume \\nthat each node contains a key attribute. The remaining attributes of interest are  \\npointers to other nodes, and they vary according to the type of tree. \\nBinary trees \\nFigure 10.6 shows how to use the attributes p, left , and right to store pointers to \\nthe parent, left child, and right child of each node in a binary tree T . If x: p D NIL , \\nthen x is the root. If node x has no left child, then x: left D NIL , and similarly for \\nthe right child. The root of the entire tree T is pointed to by the attribute T: root . If \\nT: root D NIL , then the tree is empty. \\nRooted trees with unbounded branching \\nIt’s simple to extend the scheme for representing a binary tree to any class of trees \\nin which the number of children of each node is at most some constant k: replace \\nthe left and right attributes by child 1 ; child 2 ;:::;  child k . This scheme no longer \\nworks when the number of children of a node is unbounded, however, since we do \\nnot know how many attributes to allocate in advance. Moreover, if k, the number \\nof children, is bounded by a large constant but most nodes have a small number of \\nchildren, we may waste a lot of memory. \\nFortunately, there is a clever scheme to represent trees with arbitrary numbers of \\nchildren. It has the advantage of using only O.n/ space for any n-node rooted tree. \\nThe left-child, right-sibling representation appears in Figure 10.7. As before, each \\nnode contains a parent pointer p, and T: root points to the root of tree T . Instead \\nof having a pointer to each of its children, howeve r, each node x has only two \\npointers: \\n1. x: left-child points to the leftmost child of node x , and \\n2. x: right-sibling points to the sibling of x immediately to its right. \\nIf node x has no children, then x: left-child D NIL , and if node x is the rightmost \\nchild of its parent, then x: right-sibling D NIL .

Examples of these types of \\ntextbooks include Goodrich and Tamassia [196], Main [311], Shaffer [406], and \\nWeiss [452, 453, 454]. The book by Gonnet and Baeza-Yates [193] provides ex- \\nperimental data on the performance of many data-structure operations. \\nThe origin of stacks and queues as data structures in computer science is un- \\nclear, since corresponding notions already existed in mathematics and paper-based \\nbusiness practices before the introduction of digit al computers. Knuth [259] cites \\nA. M. Turing for the development of stacks for subroutine linkage in 1947. \\nPointer-based data structures also seem to be a folk invention. According to \\nKnuth, pointers were apparently used in early computers with drum memories. The \\nA-1 language developed by G. M. Hopper in 1951 represented algebraic formulas \\nas binary trees. Knuth credits the IPL-II language, developed in 1956 by A. Newell, \\nJ. C. Shaw, and H. A. Simon, for recognizing the importance and promoting the \\nuse of pointers.

For example, a compiler that translates a \\nprogramming language maintains a symbol table, in w hich the keys of elements \\nare arbitrary character strings corresponding to identiûers in the language. A hash \\ntable is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. Although search- \\ning for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a \\nlinked list4‚.n/ time in the worst case4in practice, hashing performs extremely \\nwell. Under reasonable assumptions, the average tim e to search for an element in \\na hash table is O.1/. Indeed, the built-in dictionaries of Python are implemented \\nwith hash tables. \\nA hash table generalizes the simpler notion of an o rdinary array. Directly ad- \\ndressing into an ordinary array takes advantage of the O.1/ access time for any \\narray element. Section 11.1 discusses direct addressing in more detail. To use di- \\nrect addressing, you must be able to allocate an ar ray that contains a position for \\nevery possible key. \\nWhen the number of keys actually stored is small re lative to the total number \\nof possible keys, hash tables become an effective a lternative to directly address- \\ning an array, since a hash table typically uses an array of size proportional to the \\nnumber of keys actually stored. Instead of using the key as an array index directly, \\nwe compute the array index from the key. Section 11.2 presents the main ideas, \\nfocusing on <chaining= as a way to handle <collisio ns,= in which more than one \\nkey maps to the same array index. Section 11.3 describes how to compute array \\nindices from keys using hash functions. We present and analyze several variations \\non the basic theme. Section 11.4 looks at <open addressing,= which is another way \\nto deal with collisions.

Furthermore , the set K of keys actually \\nstored may be so small relative to U that most of the space allocated for T would \\nbe wasted. \\nWhen the set K of keys stored in a dictionary is much smaller than the uni- \\nverse U of all possible keys, a hash table requires much less storage than a direct- \\naddress table. Speciûcally, the storage requirement reduces to ‚.jKj/ while main- \\ntaining the beneût that searching for an element in the hash table still requires only \\nO.1/ time. The catch is that this bound is for the average-case time, 1 whereas for \\ndirect addressing it holds for the worst-case time. \\nWith direct addressing, an element with key k is stored in slot k, but with hash- \\ning, we use a hash function h to compute the slot number from the key k, so that \\nthe element goes into slot h.k/. The hash function h maps the universe U of keys \\ninto the slots of a hash table TŒ0 W m \\ue003 1�: \\nh W U ! f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g ; \\nwhere the size m of the hash table is typically much less than jU j. We say that \\nan element with key k hashes to slot h.k/, and we also say that h.k/ is the hash \\nvalue of key k. Figure 11.2 illustrates the basic idea. The hash function reduces \\nthe range of array indices and hence the size of the array. Instead of a size of jU j, \\nthe array can have size m. An example of a simple, but not particularly good, hash \\nfunction is h.k/ D k mod m. \\nThere is one hitch, namely that two keys may hash to the same slot. We call this \\nsituation a collision. Fortunately, there are effective techniques for r esolving the \\nconüict created by collisions. \\nOf course, the ideal solution is to avoid collisions altogether. We might try to \\nachieve this goal by choosing a suitable hash function h. One idea is to make h ap- \\npear to be <random,= thus avoiding collisions or at least minimizing their number. \\nThe very term <to hash,= evoking images of random m ixing and c hopping, cap- \\ntures the spirit of this approach. (Of course, a hash function h must be determin- \\nistic in that a given input k must always produce the same output h.k/.) Because \\njU j >m, however, there must be at least two keys that have the same hash value, \\n1 The deûnition of <average-case= requires care4are we assuming an input distribution over the \\nkeys, or are we randomizing the choice of hash function itself? We’ll consider both approaches, but \\nwith an emphasis on the use of a randomly chosen hash function. '),\n",

When hash tables are \\nimplemented with an independent uniform hash functi on, we say we are using \\nindependent uniform hashing. \\nIndependent uniform hashing is an ideal theoretical  abstraction, but it is not \\nsomething that can reasonably be implemented in pra ctice.

A hash function determines which subset \\nan element belongs to. Each subset is managed independently as a list. \\nFigure 11.3 shows the idea behind \\nchaining: each nonempty slot points to a \\nlinked list, and all the elements that hash to the same slot go into that slot’s linked \\nlist. Slot j contains a pointer to the head of the list of all stored elements with hash \\nvalue j . If there are no such elements, then slot j contains NIL . \\nWhen collisions are resolved by chaining, the dictionary operations are straight- \\nforward to implement. They appear on the next page and use the linked-list pro- \\ncedures from Section 10.2. The worst-case running time for insertion is O.1/. \\nThe insertion procedure is fast in part because it assumes that the element x be- \\ning inserted is not already present in the table.

Deletion takes O.1/ time if the \\nlists are doubly linked, as in Figure 11.3. (Since CHAINED -HASH -DELETE takes \\nas input an element x and not its key k, no search is needed.

In particular, how long does it take \\nto search for an element with a given key? \\nGiven a hash table T with m slots that stores n elements, we deûne the load \\nfactor ˛ for T as n=m, that is, the average number of elements stored in  a chain. \\nOur analysis will be in terms of ˛, which can be less than, equal to, or greater \\nthan 1. \\nThe worst-case behavior of hashing with chaining is terrible: all n keys hash \\nto the same slot, creating a list of length n. The worst-case time for searching is \\nthus ‚.n/ plus the time to compute the hash function4no better than using one \\nlinked list for all the elements. We clearly don’t use hash tables for their worst-case \\nperformance. \\nThe average-case performance of hashing depends on how well the hash func- \\ntion h distributes the set of keys to be stored among the m slots, on the average \\n(meaning with respect to the distribution of keys t o be hashed and with respect to \\nthe choice of hash function, if this choice is rand omized). S ection 11.3 discusses \\nthese issues, but for now we assume that any given element is equally likely to \\nhash into any of the m slots. That is, the hash function is uniform. We further \\nassume that where a given element hashes to is independent of where any other el- \\nements hash to. In other words, we assume that we are using independent uniform \\nhashing. \\nBecause hashes of distinct keys are assumed to be independent, independent uni- \\nform hashing is universal: the chance that any two distinct keys k 1 and k 2 collide is \\nat most 1=m.

As we saw w ith quicksort in Chapter 7, \\nrandomization is a powerful algorithmic design tool. \\nWhat makes a good hash function? \\nA good hash function satisûes (approximately) the assumption of independent uni- \\nform hashing: each key is equally likely to hash to  any of the m slots, indepen- \\ndently of where any other keys have hashed to. What  does <equally likely= mean \\nhere? If the hash function is ûxed, any probabilities would have to be based on the \\nprobability distribution of the input keys. \\nUnfortunately, you typically have no way to check t his condition, unless you \\nhappen to know the probability distribution from which the keys are drawn. More- \\nover, the keys might not be drawn independently. \\nOccasionally you might know the distribution. For example, if you know that \\nthe keys are random real numbers k independently and uniformly distributed in the \\nrange 0 හ k<1 , then the hash function \\nh.k/ D bkmc \\nsatisûes the condition of independent uniform hashing. \\nA good static hashing approach derives the hash value in a way that you expect \\nto be independent of any patterns that might exist in the data. For example, the \\n<division method= (discussed in Section 11.3.1) computes the hash value as the \\nremainder when the key is divided by a speciûed prime number. This method may \\ngive good results, if you (somehow) choose a prime number that is unrelated to any \\npatterns in the distribution of keys. \\nRandom hashing, described in Section 11.3.2, picks the hash function to be used \\nat random from a suitable family of hashing functio ns. This approach removes \\nany need to know anything about the probability dis tribution of the input keys, as \\nthe randomization necessary for good average-case behavior then comes from the \\n(known) random process used to pick the hash functi on from the family of hash \\nfunctions, rather than from the (unknown) process u sed to create the input keys. \\nWe recommend that you use random hashing. \\nKeys are integers, vectors, or strings \\nIn practice, a hash function is designed to handle keys that are one of the following \\ntwo types: \\n\\ue001 A short nonnegative integer that ûts in a w-bit machine word.

For example, \\neach element might be an 8-bit byte, in which case the vector is often called a \\n(byte) string.

Handling vector \\nkeys is more complicated and discussed in Sections 11.3.5 and 11.5.2. \\n11.3.1 Static hashing \\nStatic hashing uses a single, ûxed hash function. The only randomization available \\nis through the (usually unknown) distribution of input keys. This section discusses \\ntwo standard approaches for static hashing: the division method and the multiplica- \\ntion method. Although static hashing is no longer recommended, the multiplication \\nmethod also provides a good foundation for <nonstatic= hashing4better known as \\nrandom hashing4where the hash function is chosen at random from a suitable \\nfamily of hash functions. \\nThe division method \\nThe \\ndivision method for creating hash functions maps a key k into one of m slots \\nby taking the remainder of k divided by m. That is, the hash function is \\nh.k/ D k mod m: \\nFor example, if the hash table has size m D 12 and the key is k D 100, then \\nh.k/ D 4. Since it requires only a single division operation, hashing by division is \\nquite fast. \\nThe division method may work well when m is a prime not too close to an exact \\npower of 2.

Then the adversary can choose n keys that all hash to the same slot, \\nyielding an average retrieval time of ‚.n/. Any static hash function is vulnerable to \\nsuch terrible worst-case behavior. The only effective way to improve the situation \\nis to choose the hash function randomly in a way that is independent of the keys \\nthat are actually going to be stored. This approach  is called random hashing. A \\nspecial case of this approach, called universal hashing, can yield provably good \\nperformance on average when collisions are handled by chaining, no matter which \\nkeys the adversary chooses. \\nTo use random hashing, at the beginning of program execution you select the \\nhash function at random from a suitable family of f unctions. As in the case of \\nquicksort, randomization guarantees that no single input always evokes worst-case \\nbehavior. Because you randomly select the hash func tion, th e algorithm can be- \\nhave differently on each execution, even for the sa me set of keys to be hashed, \\nguaranteeing good average-case performance. \\nLet H be a ûnite family of hash functions that map a given universe U of keys \\ninto the range f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g. Such a family is said to be universal if for each \\npair of distinct keys k 1 ;k 2 2 U , the number of hash functions h 2 H for which \\nh.k 1 / D h.k 2 / is at most jH j =m. In other words, with a hash function randomly \\nchosen from H , the chance of a collision between distinct keys k 1 and k 2 is no \\nmore than the chance 1=m of a collision if h.k 1 / and h.k 2 / were randomly and \\nindependently chosen from the set f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g. \\nIndependent uniform hashing is the same as picking a hash function uniformly at \\nrandom from a family of m n hash functions, each member of that family mapping \\nthe n keys to the m hash values in a different way. \\nEvery independent uniform random family of hash function is universal, but the \\nconverse need not be true: consider the case where U D f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g and the \\nonly hash function in the family is the identity fu nction. The probability that two \\ndistinct keys collide is zero, even though each key is hashes to a ûxed value. '),\n",

The ûrst method is a bit \\neasier to prove universal, but the second method is newer and faster in practice. \\nA universal family of hash functions based on number theory \\nWe can design a universal family of hash functions using a little number theory. \\nYou may wish to refer to Chapter 31 if you are unfamiliar with basic concepts in \\nnumber theory. \\nBegin by choosing a prime number p large enough so that every possible key k \\nlies in the range 0 to p \\ue003 1, inclusive.

Therefore, when computing any h ab 2 H pm , distinct inputs k 1 and k 2 \\nmap to distinct values r 1 and r 2 modulo p, and there are no collisions yet at the \\n<mod p level.= Moreover, each of the possible p.p \\ue003 1/ choices for the pair .a;b/ \\nwith a ¤ 0 yields a different resulting pair .r 1 ;r 2 / with r 1 ¤ r 2 , since we can solve \\nfor a and b given r 1 and r 2 : \\na D ã .r 1 \\ue003 r 2 /..k 1 \\ue003 k 2 / \\ue0021 mod p/ ä mod p; \\nb D .r 1 \\ue003 ak 1 / mod p; \\nwhere ..k 1 \\ue003 k 2 / \\ue0021 mod p/ denotes the unique multiplicative inverse, modulo p, \\nof k 1 \\ue003 k 2 . For each of the p possible values of r 1 , there are only p \\ue003 1 possible \\nvalues of r 2 that do not equal r 1 , making only p.p \\ue003 1/ possible pairs .r 1 ;r 2 / with \\nr 1 ¤ r 2 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between pairs .a;b/ with \\na ¤ 0 and pairs .r 1 ;r 2 / with r 1 ¤ r 2 .

Cryptographic hash func- \\ntions are complex pseudorandom functions, designed for ap plications requiring \\nproperties beyond those needed here, but are robust, widely implemented, and us- \\nable as hash functions for hash tables. \\nA cryptographic hash function takes as input an arbitrary byte string and returns \\na ûxed-length output. For example, the NIST standard deterministic cryptographic \\nhash function SHA-256 [346] produces a 256-bit (32-byte) output for any input. \\nSome chip manufacturers include instructions in their CPU architectures to pro- \\nvide fast implementations of some cryptographic fun ctions. Of particular inter- \\nest are instructions that efûciently implement rounds of the Advanced Encryption \\nStandard (AES), the <AES-NI= instructions. These instructions execute in a few \\ntens of nanoseconds, which is generally fast enough  for use with hash tables. A \\nmessage authentication code such as CBC-MAC based on AES and the use of the \\nAES-NI instructions could be a useful and efûcient hash function. We don’t pursue \\nthe potential use of specialized instruction sets further here. \\nCryptographic hash functions are useful because the y provide a way of imple- \\nmenting an approximate version of a random oracle. As noted earlier, a random \\noracle is equivalent to an independent uniform hash  function family. From a the- \\noretical point of view, a random oracle is an unach ievable ideal: a deterministic \\nfunction that provides a randomly selected output for each input. Because it is de- \\nterministic, it provides the same output if queried  again for the same input. From \\na practical point of view, constructions of hash function families based on crypto- \\ngraphic hash functions are sensible substitutes for random oracles. \\nThere are many ways to use a cryptographic hash fun ction as a hash function. \\nFor example, we could deûne \\nh.k/ D SHA-256 .k/ mod m: \\nTo deûne a family of such hash functions one may prepend a <salt= string a to the \\ninput before hashing it, as in \\nh a .k/ D SHA-256 .a k k/ mod m; \\nwhere a k k denotes the string formed by concatenating the strings a and k. The lit- \\nerature on message authentication codes (MACs) provides additional approaches. \\nCryptographic approaches to hash-function design are becoming more practi- \\ncal as computers arrange their memories in hierarch ies of differing capacities and \\nspeeds.

In open \\naddressing, all elements occupy the hash table itself. That is, each table entry con- \\ntains either an element of the dynamic set or NIL . No lists or elements are stored \\noutside the table, unlike in chaining. Thus, in ope n addressing, the hash table can \\n<ûll up= so that no further insertions can be made. One consequence is that the \\nload factor ˛ can never exceed 1. \\nCollisions are handled as follows: when a new element is to be inserted into the \\ntable, it is placed in its <ûrst-choice= location if possible. If that location is already \\noccupied, the new element is placed in its <second-choice= location. The process \\ncontinues until an empty slot is found in which to place the new element. Different \\nelements have different preference orders for the locations. \\nTo search for an element, systematically examine th e preferred table slots for \\nthat element, in order of decreasing preference, un til eith er you ûnd the desired \\nelement or you ûnd an empty slot and thus verify that the element is not in the \\ntable. \\nOf course, you could use chaining and store the linked lists inside the hash table, \\nin the otherwise unused hash-table slots (see Exercise 11.2-4), but the advantage of \\nopen addressing is that it avoids pointers altogether. Instead of following pointers, \\nyou compute the sequence of slots to be examined. T he memory freed by not \\nstoring pointers provides the hash table with a lar ger number of slots in the same \\namount of memory, potentially yielding fewer collisions and faster retrieval. \\nTo perform insertion using open addressing, successively examine, or probe, the \\nhash table until you ûnd an empty slot in which to put the key. Instead of being \\nûxed in the order 0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1 (which implies a ‚.n/ search time), the sequence \\nof positions probed depends upon the key being inserted. To determine which slots \\nto probe, the hash function includes the probe number (starting from 0) as a second \\ninput. Thus, the hash function becomes \\nh W U \\ue005 f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g ! f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g : \\nOpen addressing requires that for every key k, the \\nprobe sequence hh.k;0/;h.k;1/;  \\n:::;h.k;m  \\ue003 1/i be a permutation of h0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1i, so that every hash-table \\nposition is eventually considered as a slot for a n ew key as the table ûlls up. The \\nHASH -I NSERT procedure on the following page assumes that the el ements in the \\nhash table T are keys with no satellite information: the key k is identical to the \\nelement containing key k.

Therefore, the search can \\nterminate (unsuccessfully) when it ûnds an empty slot, since k would have been \\ninserted there and not later in its probe sequence.  The procedure H ASH -SEARCH \\ntakes as input a hash table T and a key k, returning q if it ûnds that slot q contains \\nkey k, or NIL if key k is not present in table T . \\nDeletion from an open-address hash table is tricky.

One way to solve this problem \\nis by marking the slot, storing in it the special value DELETED instead of NIL .

Section 11.5.1 shows how to delete from a hash \\ntable when using linear probing. \\nIn our analysis, we assume \\nindependent uniform permutation hashing (also \\nconfusingly known as uniform hashing in the literature): the probe sequence of \\neach key is equally likely to be any of the mŠ permutations of h0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1i. \\nIndependent uniform permutation hashing generalizes  the notion of independent \\nuniform hashing deûned earlier to a hash function that produces not just a single \\nslot number, but a whole probe sequence. True indep endent uniform permutation \\nhashing is difûcult to implement, however, and in practice suitable approximations \\n(such as double hashing, deûned below) are used. \\nWe’ll examine both double hashing and its special case, linear probing. These \\ntechniques guarantee that hh.k;0/;h.k;1/;:::;h.k;m  \\ue003 1/i is a permutation \\nof h0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1i for each key k. (Recall that the second parameter to the hash \\nfunction h is the probe number.) Neither double hashing nor li near probing meets \\nthe assumption of independent uniform permutation h ashing, however. Double \\nhashing cannot generate more than m 2 different probe sequences (instead of the \\nmŠ that independent uniform permutation hashing requir es). Nonetheless, double \\nhashing has a large number of possible probe sequences and, as you might expect, \\nseems to give good results. Linear probing is even more restricted, capable of \\ngenerating only m different probe sequences. \\nDouble hashing \\nDouble hashing offers one of the best methods avail able for o pen addressing be- \\ncause the permutations produced have many of the ch aracteristics of randomly \\nchosen permutations. Double hashing uses a hash function of the form \\nh.k;i/ D .h 1 .k/ C ih \\n2 .k// mod m; \\nwhere both h 1 and h 2 are \\nauxiliary hash functions. The initial probe goes to posi- \\ntion TŒh 1 .k/�, and successive probe positions are offset from previous positions by \\nthe amount h 2 .k/, modulo m. Thus, the probe sequence here depends in two ways \\nupon the key k, since the initial probe position h 1 .k/, the step size h 2 .k/, or both, \\nmay vary. Figure 11.5 gives an example of insertion by double hashing. \\nIn order for the entire hash table to be searched, the value h 2 .k/ must be rel- \\natively prime to the hash-table size m. (See Exercise 11.4-5.) A convenient way \\nto ensure this condition is to let m be an exact power of 2 and to design h 2 so \\nthat it always produces an odd number. Another way is to let m be prime and to \\ndesign h 2 so that it always returns a positive integer less than m. For example, you '),\n",

As with double ha shing, an auxiliary hash func- \\ntion h 1 determines the ûrst probe position h 1 .k/ for inserting an element. If slot \\nTŒh 1 .k/� is already occupied, probe the next position TŒh 1 .k/ C 1�. Keep going as \\nnecessary, on up to slot TŒm \\ue003 1�, and then wrap around to slots T Œ0�, T Œ1�, and so \\non, but never going past slot TŒh 1 .k/ \\ue003 1�. To view linear probing as a special case \\nof double hashing, just set the double-hashing step function h 2 to be ûxed at 1: \\nh 2 .k/ D 1 for all k. That is, the hash function is \\nh.k;i/ D .h 1 .k/ C i/ mod m (11.6) \\nfor i D 0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1. The value of h 1 .k/ determines the entire probe sequence, \\nand so assuming that h 1 .k/ can take on any value in f0;1;:::;m  \\ue003 1g, linear prob- \\ning allows only m distinct probe sequences. \\nWe’ll revisit linear probing in Section 11.5.1. \\nAnalysis of open-address hashing \\nAs in our analysis of chaining in Section 11.2, we analyze open addressing in terms \\nof the load factor ˛ D n=m of the hash table. With open addressing, at most on e \\nelement occupies each slot, and thus n හ m, which implies ˛ හ 1. The analysis \\nbelow requires ˛ to be strictly less than 1, and so we assume that at least one slot \\nis empty. Because deleting from an open-address hash table does not really free up \\na slot, we assume as well that no deletions occur. \\nFor the hash function, we assume independent uniform permutation hashing. In \\nthis idealized scheme, the probe sequence hh.k;0/;h.k;1/;:::;h.k;m  \\ue003 1/i used \\nto insert or search for each key k is equally likely to be any permutation of h0;1; \\n:::;m  \\ue003 1i. Of course, any given key has a unique ûxed probe sequence associated \\nwith it. What we mean here is that, considering the  probability distribution on the \\nspace of keys and the operation of the hash functio n on the keys, each possible \\nprobe sequence is equally likely. \\nWe now analyze the expected number of probes for hashing with open address- \\ning under the assumption of independent uniform permutation hashing, beginning \\nwith the expected number of probes made in an unsuccessful search (assuming, as \\nstated above, that ˛<1 ). \\nThe bound proven, of 1=.1 \\ue003 ˛/ D 1 C ˛ C ˛ 2 C ˛ 3 C \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001, has an intuitive in- \\nterpretation. The ûrst probe always occurs. With probability approximately ˛, the \\nûrst probe ûnds an occupied slot, so that a second probe happens.

Constant factors can ma tter. For this reason, this \\nsection discusses two aspects of modern CPUs that are not included in the standard \\nRAM model presented in Section 2.2: \\nMemory hierarchies: The memory of modern CPUs has a number of levels, \\nfrom the fast registers, through one or more levels  of \\ncache memory, to the \\nmain-memory level. Each successive level stores more data than the previous \\nlevel, but access is slower. As a consequence, a complex computation (such as \\na complicated hash function) that works entirely wi thin the fast registers can \\ntake less time than a single read operation from ma in memory. Furthermore, \\ncache memory is organized in cache blocks of (say) 64 bytes each, which are \\nalways fetched together from main memory. There is a substantial beneût for \\nensuring that memory usage is local: reusing the sa me cache block is much \\nmore efûcient than fetching a different cache block from main memory. \\nThe standard RAM model measures efûciency of a hash-table operation by \\ncounting the number of hash-table slots probed. In practice, this metric is only \\na crude approximation to the truth, since once a ca che block is in the cache, \\nsuccessive probes to that cache block are much fast er than probes that must \\naccess main memory.

But linear probing excels for hierarchic al memory models, because \\nsuccessive probes are usually to the same cache block of memory. \\nDeletion with linear probing \\nAnother reason why linear probing is often not used  in practice is that deletion \\nseems complicated or impossible without using the s pecial DELETED value. Yet \\nwe’ll now see that deletion from a hash table based on linear probing is not all \\nthat difûcult, even without the DELETED marker. The deletion procedure works \\nfor linear probing, but not for open-address probing in general, because with lin- \\near probing keys all follow the same simple cyclic probing sequence (albeit with \\ndifferent starting points). \\nThe deletion procedure relies on an <inverse= function to the linear-probing hash \\nfunction h.k;i/ D .h 1 .k/ C i/ mod m, which maps a key k and a probe number i \\nto a slot number in the hash table.

Fortunately, having a memory hierarchy \\nmeans that complex hash functions can be implemented efûciently. \\nAs noted in Section 11.3.5, one approach is to use a cryptographic hash func- \\ntion such as SHA-256. Such functions are complex and sufûciently random for \\nhash table applications. On machines with specialized instructions, cryptographic \\nfunctions can be quite efûcient. \\nInstead, we present here a simple hash function bas ed only on addition, multi- \\nplication, and swapping the halves of a word. This function can be implemented \\nentirely within the fast registers, and on a machin e with a memory hierarchy, its \\nlatency is small compared with the time taken to ac cess a random slot of the hash \\ntable.

These experi- \\nments were run on a laptop (2019 MacBook Pro) with w D 64 and a D 123. For \\nlarge hash tables, evaluating the wee hash function  was 2 to 10 times faster than \\nperforming a single probe of the hash table. \\nThe wee hash function for variable-length inputs \\nSometimes inputs are long4more than one w-bit word in length4or have variable \\nlength, as discussed in Section 11.3.5. We can extend the wee hash function, de- \\nûned above for inputs that are at most single w-bit word in length, to handle long \\nor variable-length inputs. Here is one method for doing so. \\nSuppose that an input k has length t (measured in bits). Break k into a sequence \\nhk 1 ;k 2 ;:::;k  u i of w-bit words, where u D dt=we, k 1 contains the least-signiûcant \\nw bits of k, and k u contains the most signiûcant bits. If t is not a multiple of w, \\nthen k u contains fewer than w bits, in which case, pad out the unused high-order \\nbits of k u with 0-bits. Deûne the function chop to return a sequence of the w-bit \\nwords in k: \\nchop.k/ D hk 1 ;k 2 ;:::;k  u i : \\nThe most important property of the chop operation is that it is one-to-one, given t : \\nfor any two t -bit keys k and k 0 , if k ¤ k 0 then chop.k/ ¤ chop.k 0 /, and k can be \\nderived from chop.k/ and t . The chop operation also has the useful property that a \\nsingle-word input key yields a single-word output sequence: chop.k/ D hki. \\nWith the chop function in hand, we specify the wee hash function h a;b;t;r .k/ for \\nan input k of length t bits as follows: \\nh a;b;t;r .k/ D WEE.k;a;b;t;r;m/;  \\nwhere the procedure WEE deûned on the facing page iterates through the elements \\nof the w-bit words returned by chop.k/, applying f r \\na to the sum of the current \\nword k i and the previously computed hash value so far, ûnally returning the result \\nobtained modulo m. This deûnition for variable-length and long (multiple-word) \\ninputs is a consistent extension of the deûnition in equation (11.7) for short (single- \\nword) inputs. For practical use, we recommend that a be a randomly chosen odd \\nw-bit word, b be a randomly chosen w-bit word, and that r D 4. \\nNote that the wee hash function is really a hash fu nction family, with individ- \\nual hash functions determined by parameters a;b;t;r;  and m. The (approximate) \\n5-independence of the wee hash function family for variable-length inputs can be \\nargued based on the assumption that the 1-word wee hash function is a random or- \\nacle and on the security of the cipher-block-chaining message authentication code \\n(CBC-MAC), as studied by Bellare et al. [42]. The case here is actually simpler \\nthan that studied in the literature, since if two m essages have different lengths t \\nand t 0 , then their <keys= are different: a C 2t ¤ a C 2t 0 .

Binary search trees seem to have b een independently discovered \\nby a number of people in the late 1950s. Radix trees are often called <tries,= which \\ncomes from the middle letters in the word retrieval. Knuth [261] also discusses \\nthem. \\nMany texts, including the ûrst two editions of this book, describe a somewhat \\nsimpler method of deleting a node from a binary search tree when both of its chil- \\ndren are present. Instead of replacing node ´ by its successor y , delete node y but \\ncopy its key and satellite data into node ´. The downside of this approach is that \\nthe node actually deleted might not be the node pas sed to the delete procedure. If \\nother components of a program maintain pointers to nodes in the tree, they could \\nmistakenly end up with <stale= pointers to nodes that have been deleted. Although \\nthe deletion method presented in this edition of this book is a bit more complicated, \\nit guarantees that a call to delete node ´ deletes node ´ and only node ´. \\nSection 14.5 will show how to construct an optimal binary search tree when \\nyou know the search frequencies before constructing  the tree. That is, given the \\nfrequencies of searching for each key and the frequ encies of searching for values \\nthat fall between keys in the tree, a set of searches in the constructed binary search \\ntree examines the minimum number of nodes.

Thus, the set operations \\nare fast if the height of the search tree is small.  If its height is large, however, the \\nset operations may run no faster than with a linked list. Red-black trees are one \\nof many search-tree schemes that are <balanced= in order to guarantee that basic \\ndynamic-set operations take O.lg n/ time in the worst case. \\n13.1 Properties of red-black trees \\nA red-black tree is a binary search tree with one extra bit of stora ge per node: its \\ncolor, which can be either RED or BLACK. By constraining the node colors on \\nany simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no such path is \\nmore than twice as long as any other, so that the t ree is approximately balanced. \\nIndeed, as we’re about to see, the height of a red-black tree with n keys is at most \\n2 lg.n C 1/, which is O.lg n/. \\nEach node of the tree now contains the attributes color , key, left , right , and p. If \\na child or the parent of a node does not exist, the corresponding pointer attribute of \\nthe node contains the value NIL . Think of these NIL s as pointers to leaves (external \\nnodes) of the binary search tree and the normal, key-bearing nodes as internal nodes \\nof the tree. \\nA red-black tree is a binary search tree that satisûes the following red-black \\nproperties: \\n1. Every node is either red or black. \\n2. The root is black. \\n3. Every leaf (NIL ) is black. '),\n",

If a node is red, then both its children are black. \\n5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the \\nsame number of black nodes. \\nFigure 13.1(a) shows an example of a red-black tree. \\nAs a matter of convenience in dealing with boundary  conditio ns in red-black \\ntree code, we use a single sentinel to represent NIL (see page 262). For a red-black \\ntree T , the sentinel T: nil is an object with the same attributes as an ordinar y node \\nin the tree. Its color attribute is BLACK, and its other attributes4p, left , right , \\nand key4can take on arbitrary values. As Figure 13.1(b) shows, all pointers to NIL \\nare replaced by pointers to the sentinel T: nil. \\nWhy use the sentinel? The sentinel makes it possible to treat a NIL child of a \\nnode x as an ordinary node whose parent is x . An alternative design would use a \\ndistinct sentinel node for each NIL in the tree, so that the parent of each NIL is well \\ndeûned. That approach needlessly wastes space, however. Instead, just the one \\nsentinel T: nil represents all the NIL s4all leaves and the root’s parent. The values \\nof the attributes p, left, right , and key of the sentinel are immaterial. The red-black \\ntree procedures can place whatever values in the sentinel that yield simpler code. \\nWe generally conûne our interest to the internal nodes of a red-black tree, since \\nthey hold the key values. The remainder of this chapter omits the leaves in drawings \\nof red-black trees, as shown in Figure 13.1(c). \\nWe call the number of black nodes on any simple path from, but not including, a \\nnode x down to a leaf the black-height of the node, denoted bh.x/. By property 5, \\nthe notion of black-height is well deûned, since all descending simple paths from \\nthe node have the same number of black nodes. The black-height of a red-black \\ntree is the black-height of its root. \\nThe following lemma shows why red-black trees make good search trees. \\nLemma 13.1 \\nA red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2 lg.n C 1/. \\nProof We start by showing that the subtree rooted at any node x contains at least \\n2 bh.x/ \\ue003 1 internal nodes. We prove this claim by induction on  the height of x . If \\nthe height of x is 0, then x must be a leaf (T: nil), and the subtree rooted at x indeed \\ncontains at least 2 bh.x/ \\ue003 1 D 2 0 \\ue003 1 D 0 internal nodes. For the inductive step, \\nconsider a node x that has positive height and is an internal node. T hen node x \\nhas two children, either or both of which may be a leaf. If a child is black, then \\nit contributes 1 to x ’s black-height but not to its own. If a child is red, then it \\ncontributes to neither x ’s black-height nor its own. Therefore, each child has a \\nblack-height of either bh.x/ \\ue003 1 (if it’s black) or bh.x/ (if it’s red). Since the \\nheight of a child of x is less than the height of x itself, we can apply the inductive '),\n",

We use the term uncle for such a node. 1 Figure 13.4 \\nshows how RB-I NSERT-FIXUP operates on a sample red-black tree, with cases \\ndepending in part on the colors of a node, its parent, and its uncle. \\nWhat violations of the red-black properties might occur upon the call to \\nRB-I NSERT-FIXUP ? Property 1 certainly continues to hold (every node is either \\nred or black), as does property 3 (every leaf is black), since both children of the \\nnewly inserted red node are the sentinel T: nil. Property 5, which says that the \\nnumber of black nodes is the same on every simple path from a given node, is sat- \\nisûed as well, because node ´ replaces the (black) sentinel, and node ´ is red with \\nsentinel children. Thus, the only properties that m ight be violated are property 2, \\nwhich requires the root to be black, and property 4, which says that a red node \\ncannot have a red child. Both possible violations m ay arise because ´ is colored \\nred. Property 2 is violated if ´ is the root, and property 4 is violated if ´’s parent \\nis red. Figure 13.4(a) shows a violation of property 4 after the node ´ has been \\ninserted. \\nThe while loop of lines 1329 has two symmetric possibilities: lines 3315 deal \\nwith the situation in which node ´’s parent ´: p is a left child of ´’s grandpar- \\nent ´: p: p, and lines 17329 apply when ´’s parent is a right child. Our proof will \\nfocus only on lines 3315, relying on the symmetry in lines 17329. \\nWe’ll show that the while loop maintains the following three-part invariant at \\nthe start of each iteration of the loop: \\na. Node ´ is red. \\nb. If ´: p is the root, then ´: p is black. \\nc. If the tree violates any of the red-black properties, then it violates at most \\none of them, and the violation is of either propert y 2 or prope rty 4, but \\nnot both. If the tree violates property 2, it is be cause ´ is the root and is \\nred. If the tree violates property 4, it is because both ´ and ´: p are red. \\nPart (c), which deals with violations of red-black properties, is more central to \\nshowing that RB-I NSERT-FIXUP restores the red-black properties than parts (a) \\nand (b), which we’ll use along the way to understand situations in the code. Be- \\ncause we’ll be focusing on node ´ and nodes near it in the tree, it helps to know \\nfrom part (a) that ´ is red. Part (b) will help show that ´’s grandparent ´: p: p exists \\nwhen it’s referenced in lines 2, 3, 7, 8, 14, and 15 (recall that we’re focusing only \\non lines 3315). \\n1 Although we try to avoid gendered language in this book, the E nglish language lacks a gender- \\nneutral word for a parent’s sibling.

We’ll see that each iteration of the loop has two possible outcomes: \\neither the pointer ´ moves up the tree, or some rotations occur and then  the loop \\nterminates. \\nInitialization: Before RB-I NSERT is called, the red-black tree has no violations. \\nRB-I NSERT adds a red node ´ and calls RB-I NSERT-FIXUP . We’ll show that \\neach part of the invariant holds at the time RB-I NSERT-FIXUP is called: \\na. When RB-I NSERT-FIXUP is called, ´ is the red node that was added. \\nb. If ´: p is the root, then ´: p started out black and did not change before the \\ncall of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP . \\nc. We have already seen that properties 1, 3, and 5 hold when RB-I NSERT- \\nFIXUP is called. \\nIf the tree violates property 2 (the root must be b lack), then the red root \\nmust be the newly added node ´, which is the only internal node in the tree. \\nBecause the parent and both children of ´ are the sentinel, which is black, the \\ntree does not also violate property 4 (both children of a red node are black). \\nThus this violation of property 2 is the only violation of red-black properties \\nin the entire tree. \\nIf the tree violates property 4, then, because the children of node ´ are black \\nsentinels and the tree had no other violations prio r to ´ being added, the \\nviolation must be because both ´ and ´: p are red. Moreover, the tree violates \\nno other red-black properties. \\nMaintenance: There are six cases within the while loop, but we’ll examine only \\nthe three cases in lines 3315, when node ´’s parent ´: p is a left child of ´’s \\ngrandparent ´: p: p. The proof for lines 17329 is symmetric. The node ´: p: p \\nexists, since by part (b) of the loop invariant, if  ´: p is the root, then ´: p is \\nblack. Since RB-I NSERT-FIXUP enters a loop iteration only if ´: p is red, we \\nknow that ´: p cannot be the root. Hence, ´: p: p exists. \\nCase 1 differs from cases 2 and 3 by the color of ´’s uncle y . Line 3 makes \\ny point to ´’s uncle ´: p: p: right , and line 4 tests y ’s color. If y is red, then \\ncase 1 executes. Otherwise, control passes to cases 2 and 3. In all three cases, \\n´’s grandparent ´: p: p is black, since its parent ´: p is red, and property 4 is \\nviolated only between ´ and ´: p. '),\n",

Both ´ and its parent ´: p are red, violat- \\ning property 4. In case 1, ´’s uncle y is red. The same action occurs regardless of whether (a) ´ is a \\nright child or (b) ´ is a left child. Each of the subtrees ˛, ˇ, � , ı, and \" has a black root4possibly \\nthe sentinel4and each has the same black-height. The code for case 1 moves the blackness of ´’s \\ngrandparent down to ´’s parent and uncle, preserving property 5: all downward simple paths from a \\nnode to a leaf have the same number of blacks. The while loop continues with node ´’s grandpar- \\nent ´: p: p as the new ´. If the action of case 1 causes a new violation of property 4 to occur, it must \\nbe only between the new ´, which is red, and its parent, if it is red as well. \\nCase 1: ´’s uncle y is red \\nFigure 13.5 shows the situation for case 1 (lines 538), which occurs when \\nboth ´: p and y are red. Because ´’s grandparent ´: p: p is black, its blackness \\ncan transfer down one level to both ´: p and y , thereby ûxing the problem of ´ \\nand ´: p both being red. Having had its blackness transferre d down one level, \\n´’s grandparent becomes red, thereby maintaining property 5. The while loop \\nrepeats with ´: p: p as the new node ´, so that the pointer ´ moves up two levels \\nin the tree. \\nNow, we show that case 1 maintains the loop invariant at the start of the next \\niteration. We use ´ to denote node ´ in the current iteration, and ´ 0 D ´: p: p \\nto denote the node that will be called node ´ at the test in line 1 upon the next \\niteration. \\na.

Case 2 transforms into case 3 by a left rotation, which preserves \\nproperty 5: all downward simple paths from a node to a leaf have the same number of blacks. Case 3 \\ncauses some color changes and a right rotation, which also preserve property 5. The while loop then \\nterminates, because property 4 is satisûed: there are no longer two red nodes in a row. \\nc. We have already argued that case 1 maintains property 5, and it does not \\nintroduce a violation of properties 1 or 3. \\nIf node ´ 0 is the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 corrected \\nthe lone violation of property 4 in this iteration. Since ´ 0 is red and it is the \\nroot, property 2 becomes the only one that is viola ted, and this violation is \\ndue to ´ 0 . \\nIf node ´ 0 is not the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 has \\nnot created a violation of property 2. Case 1 corrected the lone violation \\nof property 4 that existed at the start of this iteration. It then made ´ 0 red \\nand left ´ 0 : p alone. If ´ 0 : p was black, there is no violation of property 4. \\nIf ´ 0 : p was red, coloring ´ 0 red created one violation of property 4, between ´ 0 \\nand ´ 0 : p. \\nCase 2: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a right child \\nCase 3: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a left child \\nIn cases 2 and 3, the color of ´’s uncle y is black.

Case 3 performs some color changes and a right rotation, \\nwhich preserve property 5. At this point, there are no longer two red nodes in \\na row. The while loop terminates upon the next test in line 1, since ´: p is now \\nblack. \\nWe now show that cases 2 and 3 maintain the loop invariant. (As we have just \\nargued, ´: p will be black upon the next test in line 1, and the loop body will not \\nexecute again.) \\na. Case 2 makes ´ point to ´: p, which is red. No further change to ´ or its color \\noccurs in cases 2 and 3. \\nb. Case 3 makes ´: p black, so that if ´: p is the root at the start of the next \\niteration, it is black. \\nc. As in case 1, properties 1, 3, and 5 are maintained in cases 2 and 3. \\nSince node ´ is not the root in cases 2 and 3, we know that there is no viola- \\ntion of property 2. Cases 2 and 3 do not introduce a violation of property 2, \\nsince the only node that is made red becomes a child of a black node by the \\nrotation in case 3. \\nCases 2 and 3 correct the lone violation of property 4, and they do not intro- \\nduce another violation. \\nTermination: To see that the loop terminates, observe that if only case 1 occurs, \\nthen the node pointer ´ moves toward the root in each iteration, so that eventu- \\nally ´: p is black. (If ´ is the root, then ´: p is the sentinel T: nil, which is black.) \\nIf either case 2 or case 3 occurs, then we’ve seen that the loop terminates. Since \\nthe loop terminates because ´: p is black, the tree does not violate property 4 \\nat loop termination. By the loop invariant, the onl y property that might fail to \\nhold is property 2. Line 30 restores this property by coloring the root black, so \\nthat when RB-I NSERT-FIXUP terminates, all the red-black properties hold. \\nThus, we have shown that RB-I NSERT-FIXUP correctly restores the red-black \\nproperties. \\nAnalysis \\nWhat is the running time of RB-I NSERT ?

Like T RANSPLANT , the new procedure RB-TRANSPLANT replaces the sub- \\ntree rooted at node u by the subtree rooted at node v. The RB-TRANSPLANT pro- \\ncedure differs from TRANSPLANT in two ways. First, line 1 references the sentinel \\nT: nil instead of NIL . Second, the assignment to v: p in line 6 occurs uncondition- \\nally: the procedure can assign to v: p even if v points to the sentinel.

The additional lines deal with nodes \\nx and y that may be involved in violations of the red-black properties. When the \\nnode ´ being deleted has at most one child, then y will be ´. When ´ has two \\nchildren, then, as in T REE -DELETE , y will be ´’s successor, which has no left \\nchild and moves into ´’s position in the tree. Additionally, y takes on ´’s color. \\nIn either case, node y has at most one child: node x , which takes y ’s place in the \\ntree. (Node x will be the sentinel T: nil if y has no children.) Since node y will \\nbe either removed from the tree or moved within the  tree, the procedure needs to \\nkeep track of y ’s original color. If the red-black properties might be violated after \\ndeleting node ´, RB-DELETE calls the auxiliary procedure RB-DELETE -FIXUP , \\nwhich changes colors and performs rotations to restore the red-black properties. \\nAlthough RB-DELETE contains almost twice as many lines of pseudocode a s \\nTREE -DELETE , the two procedures have the same basic structure. You can ûnd \\neach line of T REE -DELETE within RB-DELETE (with the changes of replacing \\nNIL by T: nil and replacing calls to T RANSPLANT by calls to RB-TRANSPLANT ), \\nexecuted under the same conditions. \\nIn detail, here are the other differences between the two procedures: \\n\\ue001 Lines 1 and 9 set node y as described above: line 1 when node ´ has at most \\none child and line 9 when ´ has two children. \\n\\ue001 Because node y ’s color might change, the variable y-original-color stores y ’s \\ncolor before any changes occur.

In these cases, the calls of RB-TRANSPLANT in lines 5, \\n8, and 13 set x: p correctly in line 6 of RB-TRANSPLANT . (In these calls of \\nRB-TRANSPLANT , the third parameter passed is the same as x .) \\n\\ue001 Finally, if node y was black, one or more violations of the red-black properties \\nmight arise. The call of RB-DELETE -FIXUP in line 22 restores the red-black \\nproperties. If y was red, the red-black properties still hold when y is removed \\nor moved, for the following reasons: \\n1. No black-heights in the tree have changed. (See Exercise 13.4-1.) \\n2. No red nodes have been made adjacent. If ´ has at most one child, then y \\nand ´ are the same node. That node is removed, with a child taking its place. \\nIf the removed node was red, then neither its parent nor its children can also \\nbe red, so moving a child to take its place cannot cause two red nodes to \\nbecome adjacent. If, on the other hand, ´ has two children, then y takes ´’s \\nplace in the tree, along with ´’s color, so there cannot be two adjacent red \\nnodes at y ’s new position in the tree. In addition, if y was not ´’s right child, \\nthen y ’s original right child x replaces y in the tree. Since y is red, x must \\nbe black, and so replacing y by x cannot cause two red nodes to become \\nadjacent. \\n3. Because y could not have been the root if it was red, the root remains black. \\nIf node y was black, three problems may arise, which the call of RB-DELETE - \\nFIXUP will remedy. First, if y was the root and a red child of y became the new \\nroot, property 2 is violated. Second, if both x and its new parent are red, then a \\nviolation of property 4 occurs. Third, moving y within the tree causes any simple \\npath that previously contained y to have one less black node. Thus, property 5 is \\nnow violated by any ancestor of y in the tree. We can correct the violation of prop- \\nerty 5 by saying that when the black node y is removed or moved, its blackness \\ntransfers to the node x that moves into y ’s original position, giving x an <extra= \\nblack. That is, if we add 1 to the count of black nodes on any simple path that con- \\ntains x , then under this interpretation, property 5 holds. But now another problem \\nemerges: node x is neither red nor black, thereby violating property 1. Instead, \\nnode x is either <doubly black= or <red-and-black,= and it contributes either 2 or 1, \\nrespectively, to the count of black nodes on simple paths containing x . The color \\nattribute of x will still be either RED (if x is red-and-black) or BLACK (if x is dou- \\nbly black). In other words, the extra black on a node is reüected in x ’s pointing to \\nthe node rather than in the color attribute. '),\n",

Exercises 13.4-2 and 13.4-3 ask you to show that the procedure restores \\nproperties 2 and 4, and so in the remainder of this section, we focus on property 1. \\nThe goal of the while loop in lines 1343 is to move the extra black up the tree until \\n1. x points to a red-and-black node, in which case line 44 colors x (singly) black; \\n2. x points to the root, in which case the extra black simply vanishes; or \\n3. having performed suitable rotations and recolorings, the loop exits. \\nLike RB-I NSERT-FIXUP , the RB-DELETE -FIXUP procedure handles two sym- \\nmetric situations: lines 3322 for when node x is a left child, and lines 24343 for \\nwhen x is a right child. Our proof focuses on the four cases shown in lines 3322. \\nWithin the while loop, x always points to a nonroot doubly black node. Line 2 \\ndetermines whether x is a left child or a right child of its parent x: p so that either \\nlines 3322 or 24343 will execute in a given iteration. The sibling of x is always \\ndenoted by a pointer w. Since node x is doubly black, node w cannot be T: nil, \\nbecause otherwise, the number of blacks on the simple path from x: p to the (singly \\nblack) leaf w would be smaller than the number on the simple path from x: p to x . \\nRecall that the RB-DELETE procedure always assigns to x: p before calling RB- \\nDELETE -FIXUP (either within the call of RB-TRANSPLANT in line 13 or the as- \\nsignment in line 16), even when node x is the sentinel T: nil. That is because \\nRB-DELETE -FIXUP references x ’s parent x: p in several places, and this attribute \\nmust point to the node that became x ’s parent in RB-DELETE 4even if x is T: nil. \\nFigure 13.7 demonstrates the four cases in the code when node x is a left child. \\n(As in RB-I NSERT-FIXUP , the cases in RB-DELETE -FIXUP are not mutually ex- \\nclusive.) Before examining each case in detail, let’s look more generally at how \\nwe can verify that the transformation in each of th e cases pre serves property 5. \\nThe key idea is that in each case, the transformati on applied preserves the num- \\nber of black nodes (including x ’s extra black) from (and including) the root of the \\nsubtree shown to the roots of each of the subtrees ˛; ˇ; : : : ; � . Thus, if property 5 \\nholds prior to the transformation, it continues to hold afterward. For example, in \\nFigure 13.7(a), which illustrates case 1, the number of black nodes from the root \\nto the root of either subtree ˛ or ˇ is 3, both before and after the transformation. \\n(Again, remember that node x adds an extra black.) Similarly, the number of black \\nnodes from the root to the root of any of � , ı , \", and � is 2, both before and after \\nthe transformation. 2 In Figure 13.7(b), the counting must involve the value c of the \\ncolor attribute of the root of the subtree shown, which can be either RED or BLACK. \\n2 If property 5 holds, we can assume that paths from the roots of � , ı, \", and � down to leaves contain \\none more black than do paths from the roots of ˛ and ˇ down to leaves.

We  call such a set persistent. One \\nway to implement a persistent set is to copy the en tire set whe never it is modi- \\nûed, but this approach can slow down a program and also consume a lot of space. \\nSometimes, you can do much better. \\nConsider a persistent set S with the operations I NSERT , DELETE , and SEARCH , \\nwhich you implement using binary search trees as shown in Figure 13.8(a). Main- \\ntain a separate root for every version of the set. In order to insert the key 5 into the \\nset, create a new node with key 5. This node becomes the left child of a new node \\nwith key 7, since you cannot modify the existing node with ke y 7. Similarly, the \\nnew node with key 7 becomes the left child of a new node with key 8 whose right \\nchild is the existing node with key 10. The new node with key 8 becomes, in turn, \\nthe right child of a new root r 0 with key 4 whose left child is the existing node with \\nkey 3. Thus, you copy only part of the tree and share so me of the nodes with the \\noriginal tree, as shown in Figure 13.8(b). \\nAssume that each tree node has the attributes key, left , and right but no parent. \\n(See also Exercise 13.3-6 on page 346.) \\na.

Another class of search trees, called <2-3 trees,= was introduced by \\nJ. E. Hopcroft (unpublished) in 1970. A 2-3 tree maintains balance by manipulating \\nthe degrees of nodes in the tree, where each node h as either two or three children. \\nChapter 18 covers a generalization of 2-3 trees introduced by Bayer and McCreight \\n[39], called <B-trees.= \\nRed-black trees were invented by Bayer [38] under the name <symmetric binary \\nB-trees.= Guibas and Sedgewick [202] studied their properties at length and in- \\ntroduced the red/black color convention. Andersson [16] gives a simpler-to-code \\nvariant of red-black trees. Weiss [451] calls this variant AA-trees. An AA-tree is \\nsimilar to a red-black tree except that left children can never be red. \\nSedgewick and Wayne [402] present red-black trees as a modiûed version of 2-3 \\ntrees in which a node with three children is split into two nodes with two children \\neach. One of these nodes becomes the left child of the other, and only left children \\ncan be red. They call this structure a <left-leaning red-black binary search tree.= \\nAlthough the code for left-leaning red-black binary search trees is more concise \\nthan the red-black tree pseudocode in this chapter, operations on left-leaning red- \\nblack binary search trees do not limit the number o f rotations per operation to a \\nconstant. This distinction will matter in Chapter 17. \\nTreaps, a hybrid of binary search trees and heaps, were proposed by Seidel and \\nAragon [404]. They are the default implementation of a dictionary in LEDA [324], \\nwhich is a well-implemented collection of data structures and algorithms. \\nThere are many other variations on balanced binary trees, in cluding weight- \\nbalanced trees [344], k-neighbor trees [318], and scapegoat trees [174].

Earlier parts have presented other \\nwidely applicable techniques, such as divide-and-conquer , randomization, and how \\nto solve recurrences. The techniques in this part are somewhat more sophisticated, \\nbut you will be able to use them solve many computational problems. The themes \\nintroduced in this part will recur later in this book. \\nDynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems in which you \\nmake a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution, each choice generates \\nsubproblems of the same form as the original problem, and the same subproblems \\narise repeatedly. The key strategy is to store the solution to each such subproblem \\nrather than recompute it. Chapter 14 shows how this simple idea can sometimes \\ntransform exponential-time algorithms into polynomial-time algorithms. \\nLike dynamic-programming algorithms, greedy algorithms typically apply to \\noptimization problems in which you make a set of ch oices in order to arrive at an \\noptimal solution. The idea of a greedy algorithm is to make each choice in a locally \\noptimal manner, resulting in a faster algorithm than you get with dynamic program- \\nming. Chapter 15 will help you determine when the greedy approach works. \\nThe technique of amortized analysis applies to cert ain algorithms that perform \\na sequence of similar operations. Instead of boundi ng the cost of the sequence of \\noperations by bounding the actual cost of each oper ation separately, an amortized \\nanalysis provides a worst-case bound on the actual cost of the entire sequence. One \\nadvantage of this approach is that although some op erations might be expensive, \\nmany others might be cheap. You can use amortized a nalysis when designing \\nalgorithms, since the design of an algorithm and th e analysis of its running time \\nare often closely intertwined. Chapter 16 introduces three ways to perform an \\namortized analysis of an algorithm. '),\n",

(<Programmi ng= in this context refers \\nto a tabular method, not to writing computer code.)  As we saw in Chapters 2 \\nand 4, divide-and-conquer algorithms partition the problem into disjoint subprob- \\nlems, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine their solutions to solve \\nthe original problem. In contrast, dynamic programming applies when the subprob- \\nlems overlap4that is, when subproblems share subsubproblems. In this context, \\na divide-and-conquer algorithm does more work than necessary, repeatedly solv- \\ning the common subsubproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each \\nsubsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the \\nwork of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem. \\nDynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems. Such prob- \\nlems can have many possible solutions. Each solutio n has a value, and you want \\nto ûnd a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. We call such \\na solution an optimal solution to the problem, as opposed to the optimal solution, \\nsince there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value. \\nTo develop a dynamic-programming algorithm, follow a sequence of four steps: \\n1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution. \\n2. Recursively deûne the value of an optimal solution. \\n3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion. \\n4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information. \\nSteps 133 form the basis of a dynamic-programming solution to a problem. If you \\nneed only the value of an optimal solution, and not  the solution itself, then you \\ncan omit step 4. When you do perform step 4, it often pays to maintain additional \\ninformation during step 3 so that you can easily construct an optimal solution. \\nThe sections that follow use the dynamic-programming method to solve some \\noptimization problems.

Serling Enterprises buys long steel rods and cuts them \\ninto shorter rods, which it then sells. Each cut is free. The management of Serling \\nEnterprises wants to know the best way to cut up the rods. \\nSerling Enterprises has a table giving, for i D 1;2;::: , the price p i in dollars \\nthat they charge for a rod of length i inches. The length of each rod in inches is \\nalways an integer. Figure 14.1 gives a sample price table. \\nThe rod-cutting problem is the following. Given a rod of length n inches and \\na table of prices p i for i D 1;2;:::;n , determine the maximum revenue r n ob- \\ntainable by cutting up the rod and selling the piec es. If the price p n for a rod of \\nlength n is large enough, an optimal solution might require no cutting at all. \\nConsider the case when n D 4. Figure 14.2 shows all the ways to cut up a rod \\nof 4 inches in length, including the way with no cuts at  all. Cutting a 4-inch rod \\ninto two 2-inch pieces produces revenue p 2 C p 2 D 5 C 5 D 10, which is optimal. \\nSerling Enterprises can cut up a rod of length n in 2 n\\ue0021 different ways, since they \\nhave an independent option of cutting, or not cutting, at distance i inches from the \\nleft end, for i D 1;2;:::;n  \\ue003 1. 1 We denote a decomposition into pieces using \\nordinary additive notation, so that 7 D 2 C 2 C 3 indicates that a rod of length 7 is \\ncut into three pieces4two of length 2 and one of length 3.

For large values of n, you’ll also discover \\nthat each time you increase n by 1, your program’s running time approximately \\ndoubles. \\nWhy is C UT-ROD so inefûcient? The problem is that CUT-ROD calls itself re- \\ncursively over and over again with the same paramet er values, which means that \\nit solves the same subproblems repeatedly. Figure 14.3 shows a recursion tree \\ndemonstrating what happens for n D 4: CUT-ROD.p;n/ calls CUT-ROD.p;n \\ue003 i/ \\nfor i D 1;2;:::;n .

A rod of length n has n \\ue003 1 potential locations to cut.

That is, the labels give the correspondin g cut points, measured from the \\nright-hand end of the rod. \\nUsing dynamic programming for optimal rod cutting \\nNow, let’s see how to use dynamic programming to convert CUT-ROD into an \\nefûcient algorithm. \\nThe dynamic-programming method works as follows. Instead of solving the \\nsame subproblems repeatedly, as in the naive recursion solution, arrange for each \\nsubproblem to be solved only once. There’s actually an obvious way to do so: the \\nûrst time you solve a subproblem, save its solution. If you need to refer to this \\nsubproblem’s solution again later, just look it up, rather than recomputing it. \\nSaving subproblem solutions comes with a cost: the additional memory needed \\nto store solutions. Dynamic programming thus serves  as an example of a \\ntime- \\nmemory trade-off . The savings may be dramatic. For example, we’re about to use \\ndynamic programming to go from the exponential-time algorithm for rod cutting '),\n",

A dynamic-programming approach runs in poly- \\nnomial time when the number of distinct subproblems involved is polynomial in \\nthe input size and you can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time. \\nThere are usually two equivalent ways to implement a dynamic-programming \\napproach. Solutions to the rod-cutting problem illustrate both of them. \\nThe ûrst approach is top-down with memoization. 2 In this approach, you write \\nthe procedure recursively in a natural manner, but modiûed to save the result of \\neach subproblem (usually in an array or hash table). The procedure now ûrst checks \\nto see whether it has previously solved this subproblem. If so, it returns the saved \\nvalue, saving further computation at this level. If  not, the procedure computes the \\nvalue in the usual manner but also saves it. We say that the recursive procedure has \\nbeen memoized: it <remembers= what results it has computed previously. \\nThe second approach is the bottom-up method. This approach typically de- \\npends on some natural notion of the <size= of a subproblem, such that solving any \\nparticular subproblem depends only on solving <smal ler= subproblems. Solve the \\nsubproblems in size order, smallest ûrst, storing the solution to each subproblem \\nwhen it is ûrst solved. In this way, when solving a particular subproblem, there \\nare already saved solutions for all of the smaller subproblems its solution depends \\nupon. You need to solve each subproblem only once, and when you ûrst see it, you \\nhave already solved all of its prerequisite subproblems. \\nThese two approaches yield algorithms with the same asymptotic running time, \\nexcept in unusual circumstances where the top-down approach does not actually \\nrecurse to examine all possible subproblems. The bottom-up approach often has \\nmuch better constant factors, since it has lower overhead for procedure calls. \\nThe procedures M EMOIZED -CUT-ROD and M EMOIZED -CUT-ROD-AUX on \\nthe facing page demonstrate how to memoize the top-down CUT-ROD proce- \\ndure. The main procedure M EMOIZED -CUT-ROD initializes a new auxiliary array \\nrŒ0 W n� with the value \\ue0031 which, since known revenue values are always nonneg- \\native, is a convenient choice for denoting <unknown.= M EMOIZED -CUT-ROD then \\ncalls its helper procedure, M EMOIZED -CUT-ROD-AUX, which is just the memo- \\nized version of the exponential-time procedure, CUT-ROD.

(As Section B.4 notes, the \\nadjacency relation in a directed graph is not neces sarily sy mmetric.)

In other words, no subproblem is conside red until all of the subprob- \\nlems it depends upon have been solved. Similarly, using notions that we’ll visit in \\nSection 20.3, you can view the top-down method (with memoization) for dynamic \\nprogramming as a <depth-ûrst search= of the subproblem graph. \\nThe size of the subproblem graph G D .V;E/ can help you determine the \\nrunning time of the dynamic-programming algorithm. Since you solve each sub- \\nproblem just once, the running time is the sum of t he times needed to solve each \\nsubproblem.

The goal is only to determine an order fo r multiplying matrices that \\nhas the lowest cost. Typically, the time invested in determining this optimal order \\nis more than paid for by the time saved later on wh en actually performing the \\nmatrix multiplications (such as performing only 7500 scalar multiplications instead \\nof 75,000). \\nCounting the number of parenthesizations \\nBefore solving the matrix-chain multiplication problem by dynamic programming, \\nlet us convince ourselves that exhaustively checking all possible parenthesizations \\nis not an efûcient algorithm.

When n \\ue004 2, a fully parenthesized matrix product is the produ ct of two \\nfully parenthesized matrix subproducts, and the split between the two subproducts \\nmay occur between the kth and .k C 1/st matrices for any k D 1;2;:::;n  \\ue003 1. \\nThus, we obtain the recurrence \\nP.n/ D \\n) \\n1 if n D 1; \\nn\\ue0021 X \\nkD1 \\nP.k/P.n \\ue003 k/ if n \\ue004 2: (14.6) \\nProblem 12-4 on page 329 asked you to show that the solution to a similar recur- \\nrence is the sequence of \\nCatalan numbers, which grows as �.4 n =n 3=2 /.

Characterize the structure of an optimal solution. \\n2. Recursively deûne the value of an optimal solution. \\n3. Compute the value of an optimal solution. \\n4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information. \\nWe’ll go through these steps in order, demonstrating how to apply each step to the \\nproblem. \\nStep 1: The structure of an optimal parenthesization \\nIn the ûrst step of the dynamic-programming method, you ûnd the optimal sub- \\nstructure and then use it to construct an optimal solution to the problem from opti- \\nmal solutions to subproblems. To perform this step for the matrix-chain multipli- \\ncation problem, it’s convenient to ûrst introduce some notation. Let A i Wj , where \\ni හ j , denote the matrix that results from evaluating th e product A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . \\nIf the problem is nontrivial, that is, i < j , then to parenthesize the product \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j , the product must split between A k and A kC1 for some integer k \\nin the range i හ k < j . That is, for some value of k, ûrst compute the matrices \\nA i Wk and A kC1Wj , and then multiply them together to produce the ûnal product A i Wj . \\nThe cost of parenthesizing this way is the cost of computing the matrix A i Wk , plus \\nthe cost of computing A kC1Wj , plus the cost of multiplying them together. \\nThe optimal substructure of this problem is as foll ows. Supp ose that to op- \\ntimally parenthesize A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j , you split the product between A k and A kC1 . \\nThen the way you parenthesize the <preûx= subchain A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k within this \\noptimal parenthesization of A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j must be an optimal parenthesization of \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k . Why? If there were a less costly way to parenthesize A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k , \\nthen you could substitute that parenthesization in the optimal parenthesization \\nof A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j to produce another way to parenthesize A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j whose cost \\nis lower than the optimum: a contradiction. A simil ar observation holds for how \\nto parenthesize the subchain A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j in the optimal parenthesization of \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j : it must be an optimal parenthesization of A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . \\nNow let’s use the optimal substructure to show how to construct an optimal \\nsolution to the problem from optimal solutions to s ubproblems. Any solution to a \\nnontrivial instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem requires splitting the \\nproduct, and any optimal solution contains within it optimal solutions to subprob- \\nlem instances. Thus, to build an optimal solution to an instance of the matrix-chain \\nmultiplication problem, split the problem into two subproblems (optimally paren- \\nthesizing A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k and A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j ), ûnd optimal solutions to the two \\nsubproblem instances, and then combine these optima l subproblem solutions. To \\nensure that you’ve examined the optimal split, you must consider all possible splits. '),\n",

For the matrix-chain multiplication problem, a \\nsubproblem is to determine the minimum cost of parenthesizing A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j for \\n1 හ i හ j හ n. Given the input dimensions hp 0 ;p 1 ;p 2 ;:::;p  n i, an index pair \\ni;j speciûes a subproblem. Let mŒi;j� be the minimum number of scalar multi- \\nplications needed to compute the matrix A i Wj . For the full problem, the lowest-cost \\nway to compute A 1Wn is thus mŒ1;n�. \\nWe can deûne mŒi;j� recursively as follows. If i D j , the problem is trivial: \\nthe chain consists of just one matrix A i Wi D A i , so that no scalar multiplications \\nare necessary to compute the product. Thus, mŒi;i� D 0 for i D 1;2;:::;n . To \\ncompute mŒi;j� when i < j , we take advantage of the structure of an optimal \\nsolution from step 1. Suppose that an optimal parenthesization splits the product \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j between A k and A kC1 , where i හ k < j . Then, mŒi;j� equals \\nthe minimum cost mŒi;k� for computing the subproduct A i Wk , plus the minimum \\ncost mŒk C 1;j� for computing the subproduct, A kC1Wj , plus the cost of multiplying \\nthese two matrices together. Because each matrix A i is p i \\ue0021 \\ue005 p i , computing the \\nmatrix product A i Wk A kC1Wj takes p i \\ue0021 p k p j scalar multiplications. Thus, we obtain \\nmŒi;j� D mŒi;k� C mŒk C 1;j� C p i \\ue0021 p k p j : \\nThis recursive equation assumes that you know the v alue of k. But you don’t, \\nat least not yet. You have to try all possible valu es of k. How many are there? \\nJust j \\ue003 i , namely k D i;i C 1;:::;j  \\ue003 1. Since the optimal parenthesization \\nmust use one of these values for k, you need only check them all to ûnd the best. \\nThus, the recursive deûnition for the minimum cost of parenthesizing the product \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j becomes \\nmŒi;j� D \\n( \\n0 if i D j ; \\nmin fmŒi;k� C mŒk C 1;j� C p i \\ue0021 p k p j W i හ k<j  g if i <j : \\n(14.7) \\nThe mŒi;j� values give the costs of optimal solutions to subpr oblems, but they \\ndo not provide all the information you need to cons truct an optimal solution. To \\nhelp you do so, let’s deûne sŒi;j�  to be a value of k at which you split the product \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j in an optimal parenthesization. That is, sŒi;j�  equals a value k such \\nthat mŒi;j� D mŒi;k� C mŒk C 1;j� C p i \\ue0021 p k p j . \\nStep 3: Computing the optimal costs \\nAt this point, you could write a recursive algorith m based on recurrence (14.7) to \\ncompute the minimum cost mŒ1;n� for multiplying A 1 A 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A n .

Equation (14.7) tells us that to compute the cost of matrix prod- \\nuct A i Wj , ûrst the costs of the products A i Wk and A kC1Wj need to have been com- \\nputed for all k D i;i C 1;:::;j  \\ue003 1. The chain A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j consists of j \\ue003 i C 1 \\nmatrices, and the chains A i A i C1 :::A  k and A kC1 A kC2 :::A  j consist of k \\ue003 i C 1 \\nand j \\ue003 k matrices, respectively. Since k < j , a chain of k \\ue003 i C 1 matrices \\nconsists of fewer than j \\ue003 i C 1 matrices. Likewise, since k \\ue004 i , a chain of j \\ue003 k \\nmatrices consists of fewer than j \\ue003 i C 1 matrices. Thus, the algorithm should ûll \\nin the table m from shorter matrix chains to longer matrix chains.  That is, for the \\nsubproblem of optimally parenthesizing the chain A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j , it makes sense to \\nconsider the subproblem size as the length j \\ue003 i C 1 of the chain. \\nNow, let’s see how the MATRIX -CHAIN -ORDER procedure ûlls in the mŒi;j� \\nentries in order of increasing chain length. Lines 233 initialize mŒi;i� D 0 for \\ni D 1;2;:::;n , since any matrix chain with just one matrix requi res no scalar \\nmultiplications. In the for loop of lines 4312, the loop variable l denotes the length \\nof matrix chains whose minimum costs are being computed. Each iteration of this \\nloop uses recurrence (14.7) to compute mŒi;i C l \\ue003 1� for i D 1;2;:::;n  \\ue003 l C 1. In \\nthe ûrst iteration, l D 2, and so the loop computes mŒi;i C1� for i D 1;2;:::;n \\ue0031: \\nthe minimum costs for chains of length l D 2. The second time through the loop, \\nit computes mŒi;i C 2� for i D 1;2;:::;n  \\ue003 2: the minimum costs for chains of \\nlength l D 3. And so on, ending with a single matrix chain of l ength l D n and \\ncomputing mŒ1;n�. When lines 7312 compute an mŒi;j� cost, this cost depends \\nonly on table entries mŒi;k� and mŒk C 1;j�, which have already been computed. \\nFigure 14.5 illustrates the m and s tables, as ûlled in by the MATRIX -CHAIN - \\nORDER procedure on a chain of n D 6 matrices. Since mŒi;j� is deûned only \\nfor i හ j , only the portion of the table m on or above the main diagonal is used. \\nThe ûgure shows the table rotated to make the main diagonal run horizontally. The \\nmatrix chain is listed along the bottom. Using this layout, the minimum cost mŒi;j� \\nfor multiplying a subchain A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j of matrices appears at the intersection of \\nlines running northeast from A i and northwest from A j . Reading across, each \\ndiagonal in the table contains the entries for matr ix chains of the same length. \\nMATRIX -CHAIN -ORDER computes the rows from bottom to top and from left to \\nright within each row. It computes each entry mŒi;j� using the products p i \\ue0021 p k p j \\nfor k D i;i C 1;:::;j  \\ue003 1 and all entries southwest and southeast from mŒi;j�. \\nA simple inspection of the nested loop structure of  M ATRIX -CHAIN -ORDER \\nyields a running time of O.n 3 / for the algorithm. The loops are nested three deep, \\nand each loop index (l , i , and k) takes on at most n \\ue003 1 values. Exercise 14.2-5 asks \\nyou to show that the running time of this algorithm  is in fact also �.n 3 /. The al- \\ngorithm requires ‚.n 2 / space to store the m and s tables.

In this section, we’ll examine the two key ingredients that an optimiza- \\ntion problem must have in order for dynamic programming to apply: optimal sub- \\nstructure and overlapping subproblems. We’ll also revisit and discuss more fully \\nhow memoization might help you take advantage of the overlapping-subproblems \\nproperty in a top-down recursive approach. \\nOptimal substructure \\nThe ûrst step in solving an optimization problem by dynamic programming is to \\ncharacterize the structure of an optimal solution. Recall that a problem exhibits \\noptimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it opti- \\nmal solutions to subproblems. When a problem exhibits optimal substructure, that \\ngives you a good clue that dynamic programming migh t apply. ( As Chapter 15 \\ndiscusses, it also might mean that a greedy strateg y applies, however.) Dynamic \\nprogramming builds an optimal solution to the probl em from optimal solutions to \\nsubproblems. Consequently, you must take care to en sure tha t the range of sub- \\nproblems you consider includes those used in an optimal solution. \\nOptimal substructure was key to solving both of the previous problems in this \\nchapter. In Section 14.1, we observed that the optimal way of cutting up a rod of \\nlength n (if Serling Enterprises makes any cuts at all) invo lves optimally cutting \\nup the two pieces resulting from the ûrst cut.

You show that a solution to the problem consists of making a choice, such as \\nchoosing an initial cut in a rod or choosing an index at which to split the matrix \\nchain. Making this choice leaves one or more subproblems to be solved. \\n2. You suppose that for a given problem, you are gi ven the choice that leads to an \\noptimal solution. You do not concern yourself yet w ith how to determine this \\nchoice. You just assume that it has been given to you. \\n3. Given this choice, you determine which subproblems ensue and how to best \\ncharacterize the resulting space of subproblems. \\n4. You show that the solutions to the subproblems used within an optimal solution \\nto the problem must themselves be optimal by using a <cut-and-paste= tech- \\nnique. You do so by supposing that each of the subp roblem solutions is not \\noptimal and then deriving a contradiction. In parti cular, by <cutting out= the \\nnonoptimal solution to each subproblem and <pasting in= the optimal one, you \\nshow that you can get a better solution to the original problem, thus contradict- \\ning your supposition that you already had an optima l solution. If an optimal \\nsolution gives rise to more than one subproblem, th ey are typically so similar \\nthat you can modify the cut-and-paste argument for one to apply to the others \\nwith little effort. \\nTo characterize the space of subproblems, a good ru le of thumb says to try to \\nkeep the space as simple as possible and then expand it as necessary. For example, \\nthe space of subproblems for the rod-cutting problem contained the problems of \\noptimally cutting up a rod of length i for each size i . This subproblem space \\nworked well, and it was not necessary to try a more general space of subproblems. \\nConversely, suppose that you tried to constrain the subproblem space for matrix- \\nchain multiplication to matrix products of the form  A 1 A 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . As before, an \\noptimal parenthesization must split this product be tween A k and A kC1 for some \\n1 හ k<j  . Unless you can guarantee that k always equals j \\ue003 1, you will ûnd that \\nyou have subproblems of the form A 1 A 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k and A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . Moreover, \\nthe latter subproblem does not have the form A 1 A 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . To solve this problem by \\ndynamic programming, you need to allow the subproblems to vary at <both ends.= \\nThat is, both i and j need to vary in the subproblem of parenthesizing the product \\nA i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . \\nOptimal substructure varies across problem domains in two ways: \\n1. how many subproblems an optimal solution to the original problem uses, and \\n2. how many choices you have in determining which s ubproblem(s) to use in an \\noptimal solution.

Matrix-chain multiplication for \\nthe subchain A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j serves an example with two subproblems and j \\ue003 i \\nchoices. For a given matrix A k where the product splits, two subproblems arise4 \\nparenthesizing A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k and parenthesizing A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j 4and we have \\nto solve both of them optimally. Once we determine the optimal solutions to sub- \\nproblems, we choose from among j \\ue003 i candidates for the index k. \\nInformally, the running time of a dynamic-programming algorithm depends on \\nthe product of two factors: the number of subproble ms overall and how many \\nchoices you look at for each subproblem. In rod cutting, we had ‚.n/ subproblems \\noverall, and at most n choices to examine for each, yielding an O.n 2 / running time. \\nMatrix-chain multiplication had ‚.n 2 / subproblems overall, and each had at most \\nn \\ue003 1 choices, giving an O.n 3 / running time (actually, a ‚.n 3 / running time, by \\nExercise 14.2-5). \\nUsually, the subproblem graph gives an alternative way to perform the same \\nanalysis. Each vertex corresponds to a subproblem, and the choices for a subprob- \\nlem are the edges incident from that subproblem. Re call that in rod cutting, the \\nsubproblem graph has n vertices and at most n edges per vertex, yielding an O.n 2 / \\nrunning time. For matrix-chain multiplication, if you were to draw the subprob- \\nlem graph, it would have ‚.n 2 / vertices and each vertex would have degree at \\nmost n \\ue003 1, giving a total of O.n 3 / vertices and edges. \\nDynamic programming often uses optimal substructure in a bo ttom-up fashion. \\nThat is, you ûrst ûnd optimal solutions to subproblems and, having solved the \\nsubproblems, you ûnd an optimal solution to the problem. Finding an optimal so- \\nlution to the problem entails making a choice among subproblems as to which you \\nwill use in solving the problem. The cost of the pr oblem solution is usually the \\nsubproblem costs plus a cost that is directly attri butable to the choice itself. In \\nrod cutting, for example, ûrst we solved the subproblems of determining optimal \\nways to cut up rods of length i for i D 0;1;:::;n  \\ue003 1, and then we determined \\nwhich of these subproblems yielded an optimal solut ion for a rod of length n, us- \\ning equation (14.2). The cost attributable to the choice itself is the term p i in \\nequation (14.2). In matrix-chain multiplication, we determined optimal parenthe- \\nsizations of subchains of A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j , and then we chose the matrix A k at which \\nto split the product. The cost attributable to the choice itself is the term p i \\ue0021 p k p j . \\nChapter 15 explores <greedy algorithms,= which have many similarities to dy- \\nnamic programming. In particular, problems to which  greedy algorithms apply \\nhave optimal substructure. One major difference between greedy algorithms and \\ndynamic programming is that instead of ûrst ûnding optimal solutions to subprob- \\nlems and then making an informed choice, greedy algorithms ûrst make a <greedy= \\nchoice4the choice that looks best at the time4and then solve a resulting subprob- '),\n",

Surpris- \\ningly, in some cases this strategy works! \\nSubtleties \\nYou should be careful not to assume that optimal substructure applies when it does \\nnot. Consider the following two problems whose input consists of a directed graph \\nG D .V;E/ and vertices u;v 2 V . \\nUnweighted shortest path: 5 Find a path from u to v consisting of the fewest \\nedges. Such a path must be simple, since removing a cycle from a path produces \\na path with fewer edges. \\nUnweighted longest simple path: Find a simple path from u to v consisting of \\nthe most edges. (Without the requirement that the p ath must be simple, the \\nproblem is undeûned, since repeatedly traversing a cycle creates paths with an \\narbitrarily large number of edges.) \\nThe unweighted shortest-path problem exhibits optimal substructure. Here’s \\nhow. Suppose that u ¤ v, so that the problem is nontrivial. Then, any path  p \\nfrom u to v must contain an intermediate vertex, say w. (Note that w may be u \\nor v.) Then, we can decompose the path u \\np \\n❀ v into subpaths u \\np 1 \\n❀ w \\np 2 \\n❀ v. The \\nnumber of edges in p equals the number of edges in p 1 plus the number of edges \\nin p 2 . We claim that if p is an optimal (i.e., shortest) path from u to v, then p 1 \\nmust be a shortest path from u to w. Why? As suggested earlier, use a <cut-and- \\npaste= argument: if there were another path, say p 0 \\n1 , from u to w with fewer edges \\nthan p 1 , then we could cut out p 1 and paste in p 0 \\n1 to produce a path u \\np 0 \\n1 \\n❀ w \\np 2 \\n❀ v \\nwith fewer edges than p, thus contradicting p’s optimality. Likewise, p 2 must be \\na shortest path from w to v. Thus, to ûnd a shortest path from u to v, consider \\nall intermediate vertices w, ûnd a shortest path from u to w and a shortest path \\nfrom w to v, and choose an intermediate vertex w that yields the overall shortest \\npath. Section 23.2 uses a variant of this observation of optimal substructure to ûnd \\na shortest path between every pair of vertices on a weighted, directed graph. \\nYou might be tempted to assume that the problem of ûnding an unweighted \\nlongest simple path exhibits optimal substructure a s well. After all, if we decom- \\npose a longest simple path u \\np \\n❀ v into subpaths u \\np 1 \\n❀ w \\np 2 \\n❀ v, then mustn’t p 1 \\nbe a longest simple path from u to w, and mustn’t p 2 be a longest simple path \\nfrom w to v? The answer is no! Figure 14.6 supplies an example. Consider the \\n5 We use the term <unweighted= to distinguish this problem from that of ûnding shortest paths with \\nweighted edges, which we shall see in Chapters 22 and 23. You can use the breadth-ûrst search \\ntechnique of Chapter 20 to solve the unweighted problem. '),\n",

No again, for the path \\nr ! q ! s ! t is a simple path that is longer. \\nThis example shows that for longest simple paths, n ot only does the problem \\nlack optimal substructure, but you cannot necessari ly assemble a <legal= solution \\nto the problem from solutions to subproblems. If yo u combine the longest simple \\npaths q ! s ! t ! r and r ! q ! s ! t , you get the path q ! s ! t ! r ! \\nq ! s ! t , which is not simple. Indeed, the problem of ûnding an unweighted \\nlongest simple path does not appear to have any sor t of optimal substructure. No \\nefûcient dynamic-programming algorithm for this problem has ever been found. In \\nfact, this problem is NP-complete, which4as we shall see in Chapter 344means \\nthat we are unlikely to ûnd a way to solve it in polynomial time. \\nWhy is the substructure of a longest simple path so different from that of a short- \\nest path? Although a solution to a problem for both longest and shortest paths uses \\ntwo subproblems, the subproblems in ûnding the longest simple path are not inde- \\npendent, whereas for shortest paths they are. What do we m ean by subproblems \\nbeing independent? We mean that the solution to one subproblem does not affect \\nthe solution to another subproblem of the same prob lem. For t he example of Fig- \\nure 14.6, we have the problem of ûnding a longest simple path from q to t with \\ntwo subproblems: ûnding longest simple paths from q to r and from r to t . For \\nthe ûrst of these subproblems, we chose the path q ! s ! t ! r , which used \\nthe vertices s and t . These vertices cannot appear in a solution to the  second sub- \\nproblem, since the combination of the two solutions  to subproblems yields a path \\nthat is not simple. If vertex t cannot be in the solution to the second problem, then \\nthere is no way to solve it, since t is required to be on the path that forms the solu- \\ntion, and it is not the vertex where the subproblem solutions are <spliced= together \\n(that vertex being r ). Because vertices s and t appear in one subproblem solution, \\nthey cannot appear in the other subproblem solution. One of them must be in the \\nsolution to the other subproblem, however, and an o ptimal solution requires both. '),\n",

Looked at another way, \\nusing resources in solving one subproblem (those resources being vertices) renders \\nthem unavailable for the other subproblem. \\nWhy, then, are the subproblems independent for ûnding a shortest path? The \\nanswer is that by nature, the subproblems do not sh are resources. We claim that \\nif a vertex w is on a shortest path p from u to v, then we can splice together any \\nshortest path u \\np 1 \\n❀ w and any shortest path w \\np 2 \\n❀ v to produce a shortest path from u \\nto v. We are assured that, other than w, no vertex can appear in both paths p 1 \\nand p 2 . Why? Suppose that some vertex x ¤ w appears in both p 1 and p 2 , so that \\nwe can decompose p 1 as u \\np ux \\n❀ x ❀ w and p 2 as w ❀ x \\np xv \\n❀ v. By the optimal \\nsubstructure of this problem, path p has as many edges as p 1 and p 2 together. Let’s \\nsay that p has e edges. Now let us construct a path p 0 D u \\np ux \\n❀ x \\np xv \\n❀ v from u to v. \\nBecause we have excised the paths from x to w and from w to x , each of which \\ncontains at least one edge, path p 0 contains at most e \\ue003 2 edges, which contradicts \\nthe assumption that p is a shortest path. Thus, we are assured that the subproblems \\nfor the shortest-path problem are independent. \\nThe two problems examined in Sections 14.1 and 14.2 have independent sub- \\nproblems. In matrix-chain multiplication, the subproblems are multiplying sub- \\nchains A i A i C1 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A k and A kC1 A kC2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 A j . These subchains are disjoint, so that \\nno matrix could possibly be included in both of them. In rod cutting, to determine \\nthe best way to cut up a rod of length n, we looked at the best ways of cutting up \\nrods of length i for i D 0;1;:::;n  \\ue003 1. Because an optimal solution to the length-n \\nproblem includes just one of these subproblem solutions (after cutting off the ûrst \\npiece), independence of subproblems is not an issue. \\nOverlapping subproblems \\nThe second ingredient that an optimization problem must have for dynamic pro- \\ngramming to apply is that the space of subproblems must be <small= in the sense \\nthat a recursive algorithm for the problem solves t he same subproblems over and \\nover, rather than always generating new subproblems. Typically, the total number \\nof distinct subproblems is a polynomial in the inpu t size. Wh en a recursive algo- \\nrithm revisits the same problem repeatedly, we say that the optimization problem \\nhas overlapping subproblems. 6 In contrast, a problem for which a divide-and- \\n6 It may seem strange that dynamic programming relies  on subproblems being both independent \\nand overlapping.

The idea is to \\nmemoize the natural, but inefûcient, recursive algorithm. As in the bottom-up ap- \\nproach, you maintain a table with subproblem soluti ons, but the control structure \\nfor ûlling in the table is more like the recursive algorithm. \\nA memoized recursive algorithm maintains an entry in a table for the solution to \\neach subproblem.

Subtrees shaded blue represent values that \\nare looked up rather than recomputed. \\nLike the bottom-up procedure MATRIX -CHAIN -ORDER , the memoized proce- \\ndure M EMOIZED -MATRIX -CHAIN runs in O.n 3 / time. To begin with, line 4 of \\nMEMOIZED -MATRIX -CHAIN executes ‚.n 2 / times, which dominates the running \\ntime outside of the call to L OOKUP-CHAIN in line 5. We can categorize the calls \\nof LOOKUP-CHAIN into two types: \\n1. calls in which mŒi;j� D 1, so that lines 339 execute, and \\n2. calls in which mŒi;j�<  1, so that LOOKUP-CHAIN simply returns in line 2. \\nThere are ‚.n 2 / calls of the ûrst type, one per table entry. All calls of the sec- \\nond type are made as recursive calls by calls of the ûrst type. Whenever a given \\ncall of L OOKUP-CHAIN makes recursive calls, it makes O.n/ of them. There- \\nfore, there are O.n 3 / calls of the second type in all. Each call of the s econd type \\ntakes O.1/ time, and each call of the ûrst type takes O.n/ time plus the time spent \\nin its recursive calls. The total time, therefore, is O.n 3 /. Memoization thus turns \\nan �.2 n /-time algorithm into an O.n 3 /-time algorithm. \\nWe have seen how to solve the matrix-chain multiplication problem by either a \\ntop-down, memoized dynamic-programming algorithm or a bottom-up dynamic- \\nprogramming algorithm in O.n 3 / time. Both the bottom-up and memoized meth- \\nods take advantage of the overlapping-subproblems property.

We can, and do, deûne sim- \\nilarity in many different ways. For example, we can say that two DNA strands are \\nsimilar if one is a substring of the other. (Chapter 32 explores algorithms to solve \\nthis problem.) In our example, neither S 1 nor S 2 is a substring of the other. Alter- \\nnatively, we could say that two strands are similar if the number of changes needed \\nto turn one into the other is small. (Problem 14-5 looks at this notion.) Yet another \\nway to measure the similarity of strands S 1 and S 2 is by ûnding a third strand S 3 \\nin which the bases in S 3 appear in each of S 1 and S 2 . These bases must appear \\nin the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. The longer the strand S 3 we \\ncan ûnd, the more similar S 1 and S 2 are. In our example, the longest strand S 3 is \\nGTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA . \\nWe formalize this last notion of similarity as the longest-common-subsequence \\nproblem. A subsequence of a given sequence is just the given sequence with 0 or \\nmore elements left out. Formally, given a sequence X D hx 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  m i, another \\nsequence Z D h ´ 1 ;´ 2 ;:::;´  k i is a subsequence of X if there exists a strictly \\nincreasing sequence hi 1 ;i 2 ;:::;i  k i of indices of X such that for all j D 1;2;:::;k , \\nwe have x i j D ´ j . For example, Z D h B;C;D;B  i is a subsequence of X D \\nhA;B;C;B;D;A;B  i with corresponding index sequence h2;3;5;7 i. \\nGiven two sequences X and Y , we say that a sequence Z is a common sub- \\nsequence of X and Y if Z is a subsequence of both X and Y . For example, if \\nX D hA;B;C;B;D;A;B  i and Y D hB;D;C;A;B;A i, the sequence hB;C;A i is \\na common subsequence of both X and Y . The sequence hB;C;A i is not a longest \\ncommon subsequence ( LCS) of X and Y , however, since it has length 3 and the \\nsequence hB;C;B;A i, which is also common to both sequences X and Y , has \\nlength 4. The sequence hB;C;B;A i is an LCS of X and Y , as is the sequence \\nhB;D;A;B  i, since X and Y have no common subsequence of length 5 or greater. \\nIn the longest-common-subsequence problem, the input is two sequences X D \\nhx 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  m i and Y D h y 1 ;y 2 ;:::;y  n i, and the goal is to ûnd a maximum- \\nlength common subsequence of X and Y . This section shows how to efûciently \\nsolve the LCS problem using dynamic programming. \\nStep 1: Characterizing a longest common subsequence \\nYou can solve the LCS problem with a brute-force approach: enumerate all subse- \\nquences of X and check each subsequence to see whether it is also a subsequence \\nof Y , keeping track of the longest subsequence you ûnd. Each subsequence of X \\ncorresponds to a subset of the indices f1;2;:::;m g of X . Because X has 2 m sub- \\nsequences, this approach requires exponential time, making it impractical for long \\nsequences. '),\n",

As we’ll see, the natural classes of subproblems corre- \\nspond to pairs of <preûxes= of the two input sequences.

If x m ¤ y n and ´ k ¤ y n , then Z is an LCS of X and Y n\\ue0021 . \\nProof (1) If ´ k ¤ x m , then we could append x m D y n to Z to obtain a common \\nsubsequence of X and Y of length k C 1, contradicting the supposition that Z is \\na longest common subsequence of X and Y . Thus, we must have ´ k D x m D y n . \\nNow, the preûx Z k\\ue0021 is a length-.k \\ue003 1/ common subsequence of X m\\ue0021 and Y n\\ue0021 . \\nWe wish to show that it is an LCS. Suppose for the purpose of contradiction \\nthat there exists a common subsequence W of X m\\ue0021 and Y n\\ue0021 with length greater \\nthan k \\ue003 1. Then, appending x m D y n to W produces a common subsequence of \\nX and Y whose length is greater than k, which is a contradiction. \\n(2) If ´ k ¤ x m , then Z is a common subsequence of X m\\ue0021 and Y . If there were a \\ncommon subsequence W of X m\\ue0021 and Y with length greater than k, then W would \\nalso be a common subsequence of X m and Y , contradicting the assumption that Z \\nis an LCS of X and Y . \\n(3) The proof is symmetric to (2). \\nThe way that Theorem 14.1 characterizes longest common subsequences says \\nthat an LCS of two sequences contains within it an LCS of preûxes of the two se- \\nquences.

Because these \\ncases exhaust all possibilities, one of the optimal subproblem solutions must appear \\nwithin an LCS of X and Y . \\nThe LCS problem has the overlapping-subproblems property. Here’s how. To \\nûnd an LCS of X and Y , you might need to ûnd the LCSs of X and Y n\\ue0021 and of \\nX m\\ue0021 and Y . But each of these subproblems has the subsubproblem of ûnding an \\nLCS of X m\\ue0021 and Y n\\ue0021 . Many other subproblems share subsubproblems. \\nAs in the matrix-chain multiplication problem, solving the LCS problem recur- \\nsively involves establishing a recurrence for the value of an optimal solution. Let’s \\ndeûne cŒi;j�  to be the length of an LCS of the sequences X i and Y j . If either i D 0 \\nor j D 0, one of the sequences has length 0, and so the LCS  has length 0.

Otherwise, you instead consider the two \\nsubproblems of ûnding an LCS of X i and Y j \\ue0021 and of X i \\ue0021 and Y j . In the pre- \\nvious dynamic-programming algorithms we have examined4for rod cutting and \\nmatrix-chain multiplication4we didn’t rule out any subproblems due to conditions \\nin the problem. Finding an LCS is not the only dynamic-programming algorithm \\nthat rules out subproblems based on conditions in t he problem. For example, the \\nedit-distance problem (see Problem 14-5) has this characteristic. \\nStep 3: Computing the length of an LCS \\nBased on equation (14.9), you could write an exponential-time recursive algorithm \\nto compute the length of an LCS of two sequences. Since the LCS problem has only \\n‚.mn/ distinct subproblems (computing cŒi;j�  for 0 හ i හ m and 0 හ j හ n), \\ndynamic programming can compute the solutions bottom up. \\nThe procedure LCS-LENGTH on the next page takes two sequences X D hx 1 ; \\nx 2 ;:::;x  m i and Y D h y 1 ;y 2 ;:::;y  n i as inputs, along with their lengths.

We call suc h a tree an optimal binary \\nsearch tree. Figure 14.9(a) shows one binary search tree, with expected cost 2:80, \\nfor the probabilities given in the ûgure caption. Part (b) of the ûgure displays an \\noptimal binary search tree, with expected cost 2:75. This example demonstrates \\nthat an optimal binary search tree is not necessari ly a tree whose overall height \\nis smallest. Nor does an optimal binary search tree  always have the key with the \\ngreatest probability at the root. Here, key k 5 has the greatest search probability of \\nany key, yet the root of the optimal binary search tree shown is k 2 . (The lowest \\nexpected cost of any binary search tree with k 5 at the root is 2.85.) \\nAs with matrix-chain multiplication, exhaustive checking of all possibilities fails \\nto yield an efûcient algorithm. You can label the nodes of any n-node binary tree \\nwith the keys k 1 ;k 2 ;:::;k  n to construct a binary search tree, and then add in the \\ndummy keys as leaves. In Problem 12-4 on page 329, we saw that the number \\nof binary trees with n nodes is �.4 n =n 3=2 /. Thus you would need to examine an \\nexponential number of binary search trees to perfor m an exhaustive search. We’ll \\nsee how to solve this problem more efûciently with dynamic programming. \\nStep 1: The structure of an optimal binary search tree \\nTo characterize the optimal substructure of optimal  binary search trees, we start \\nwith an observation about subtrees. Consider any su btree of a binary search tree. \\nIt must contain keys in a contiguous range k i ;:::;k  j , for some 1 හ i හ j හ n. \\nIn addition, a subtree that contains keys k i ;:::;k  j must also have as its leaves the \\ndummy keys d i \\ue0021 ;:::;d  j . \\nNow we can state the optimal substructure: if an op timal binary search tree T \\nhas a subtree T 0 containing keys k i ;:::;k  j , then this subtree T 0 must be optimal as \\nwell for the subproblem with keys k i ;:::;k  j and dummy keys d i \\ue0021 ;:::;d  j . The \\nusual cut-and-paste argument applies. If there were a subtree T 00 whose expected \\ncost is lower than that of T 0 , then cutting T 0 out of T and pasting in T 00 would \\nresult in a binary search tree of lower expected cost than T , thus contradicting the \\noptimality of T . \\nWith the optimal substructure in hand, here is how to construct an optimal solu- \\ntion to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. Given keys k i ;:::;k  j , \\none of these keys, say k r (i හ r හ j ), is the root of an optimal subtree contain- \\ning these keys. The left subtree of the root k r contains the keys k i ;:::;k  r \\ue0021 (and \\ndummy keys d i \\ue0021 ;:::;d  r \\ue0021 ), and the right subtree contains the keys k r C1 ;:::;k  j \\n(and dummy keys d r ;:::;d  j ). As long as you examine all candidate roots k r , '),\n",

Sup- \\npose that in a subtree with keys k i ;:::;k  j , you select k i as the root. By the above \\nargument, k i ’s left subtree contains the keys k i ;:::;k  i \\ue0021 : no keys at all. Bear in \\nmind, however, that subtrees also contain dummy key s. We adopt the convention \\nthat a subtree containing keys k i ;:::;k  i \\ue0021 has no actual keys but does contain the \\nsingle dummy key d i \\ue0021 . Symmetrically, if you select k j as the root, then k j ’s right \\nsubtree contains the keys k j C1 ;:::;k  j . This right subtree contains no actual keys, \\nbut it does contain the dummy key d j . \\nStep 2: A recursive solution \\nTo deûne the value of an optimal solution recursively, the subproblem domain is \\nûnding an optimal binary search tree containing the keys k i ;:::;k  j , where i \\ue004 1, \\nj හ n, and j \\ue004 i \\ue003 1. (When j D i \\ue003 1, there is just the dummy key d i \\ue0021 , \\nbut no actual keys.) Let eŒi;j�  denote the expected cost of searching an optimal \\nbinary search tree containing the keys k i ;:::;k  j . Your goal is to compute eŒ1;n�, \\nthe expected cost of searching an optimal binary se arch tree for all the actual and \\ndummy keys. \\nThe easy case occurs when j D i \\ue003 1. Then the subproblem consists of just the \\ndummy key d i \\ue0021 . The expected search cost is eŒi;i \\ue003 1� D q i \\ue0021 . \\nWhen j \\ue004 i , you need to select a root k r from among k i ;:::;k  j and then \\nmake an optimal binary search tree with keys k i ;:::;k  r \\ue0021 as its left subtree and \\nan optimal binary search tree with keys k r C1 ;:::;k  j as its right subtree. What \\nhappens to the expected search cost of a subtree wh en it becomes a subtree of a \\nnode? The depth of each node in the subtree increases by 1. By equation (14.11), \\nthe expected search cost of this subtree increases by the sum of all the probabilities \\nin the subtree.

For both problem \\ndomains, the subproblems consist of contiguous index subranges. A direct, recur- \\nsive implementation of equation (14.14) would be just as inefûcient as a direct, \\nrecursive matrix-chain multiplication algorithm. Instead, you can store the eŒi;j�  \\nvalues in a table eŒ1 W n C 1;0 W n�. The ûrst index needs to run to n C 1 rather than n \\nbecause in order to have a subtree containing only the dummy key d n , you need to \\ncompute and store eŒn C 1;n�.

You want to compress this picture slightly, by removing one pixel from each \\nof the m rows, so that the whole picture becomes one pixel n arrower. To avoid \\nincongruous visual effects, however, the pixels removed in two adjacent rows must \\nlie in either the same column or adjacent columns. In this way, the pixels removed \\nform a <seam= from the top row to the bottom row, where successive pixels in the \\nseam are adjacent vertically or diagonally. \\na. Show that the number of such possible seams grows at least exponentially in m, \\nassuming that n>1 . \\nb. Suppose now that along with each pixel AŒi;j�, you are given a real-valued \\ndisruption measure dŒi;j� , indicating how disruptive it would be to remove \\npixel AŒi;j�. Intuitively, the lower a pixel’s disruption measure, the more sim- \\nilar the pixel is to its neighbors.

Because this operation copies the string, it costs n time units to \\nbreak a string of n characters into two pieces. Suppose that you want t o break a \\nstring into many pieces. The order in which the bre aks occur can affect the total \\namount of time used. For example, suppose that you want to break a 20-character \\nstring after characters 2, 8, and 10 (numbering the characters in ascending order \\nfrom the left-hand end, starting from 1). If you program the breaks to occur in \\nleft-to-right order, then the ûrst break costs 20 time units, the second break costs \\n18 time units (breaking the string from characters 3 to 20 at character 8), and the \\nthird break costs 12 time units, totaling 50 time units. If you program the breaks \\nto occur in right-to-left order, however, then the ûrst break costs 20 time units, the '),\n",

In yet another order, you could break ûrst at 8 (costing 20), then break \\nthe left piece at 2 (costing another 8), and ûnally the right piece at 10 (costing 12), \\nfor a total cost of 40. \\nDesign an algorithm that, given the numbers of characters after which to break, \\ndetermines a least-cost way to sequence those breaks.

They \\ncall a dynamic-programming algorithm tD=eD if its table size is O.n t / and each \\nentry depends on O.n e / other entries.

For many optimi zation prob lems, using dy- \\nnamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill, and simpler, more \\nefûcient algorithms will do. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that \\nlooks best at the moment. That is, it makes a local ly optimal choice in the hope \\nthat this choice leads to a globally optimal soluti on. This c hapter explores opti- \\nmization problems for which greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions. Before \\nreading this chapter, you should read about dynamic programming in Chapter 14, \\nparticularly Section 14.3. \\nGreedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many prob- \\nlems they do. We ûrst examine, in Section 15.1, a simple but nontrivial problem, \\nthe activity-selection problem, for which a greedy algorithm efûciently computes \\nan optimal solution. We’ll arrive at the greedy algorithm by ûrst considering a \\ndynamic-programming approach and then showing that an optimal solution can re- \\nsult from always making greedy choices. Section 15.2 reviews the basic elements \\nof the greedy approach, giving a direct approach for proving greedy algorithms cor- \\nrect. Section 15.3 presents an important application of greedy techniques: design- \\ning data-compression (Huffman) codes. Finally, Section 15.4 shows that in order \\nto decide which blocks to replace when a miss occur s in a cache, the <furthest-in- \\nfuture= strategy is optimal if the sequence of block accesses is known in advance. \\nThe greedy method is quite powerful and works well for a wide range of prob- \\nlems. Later chapters will present many algorithms that you can view as applications \\nof the greedy method, including minimum-spanning-tree algorithms (Chapter 21), \\nDijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths from a single source (Section 22.3), and a \\ngreedy set-covering heuristic (Section 35.3). Minimum-spanning-tree algorithms \\nfurnish a classic example of the greedy method. Although you can read this chapter \\nand Chapter 21 independently of each other, you might ûnd it useful to read them \\ntogether. '),\n",

Imagine that you are in charge of scheduling \\na conference room. You are presented with a set S D fa 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  n g of n pro- \\nposed activities that wish to reserve the conference room, and the r oom can serve \\nonly one activity at a time. Each activity a i has a start time s i and a ûnish time f i , \\nwhere 0 හ s i <f i < 1. If selected, activity a i takes place during the half-open \\ntime interval Œs i ;f i /. Activities a i and a j are compatible if the intervals Œs i ;f i / \\nand Œs j ;f j / do not overlap. That is, a i and a j are compatible if s i \\ue004 f j or s j \\ue004 f i . \\n(Assume that if your staff needs time to change over the room from one activity to \\nthe next, the changeover time is built into the int ervals.) In the activity-selection \\nproblem, your goal is to select a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible ac- \\ntivities. Assume that the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order of \\nûnish time: \\nf 1 හ f 2 හ f 3 හ \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 හ f n\\ue0021 හ f n : (15.1) \\n(We’ll see later the advantage that this assumption provides.) For example, con- \\nsider the set of activities in Figure 15.1. The subset fa 3 ;a 9 ;a 11 g consists of mutu- \\nally compatible activities. It is not a maximum sub set, however, since the subset \\nfa 1 ;a 4 ;a 8 ;a 11 g is larger. In fact, fa 1 ;a 4 ;a 8 ;a 11 g is a largest subset of mutually \\ncompatible activities, and another largest subset is fa 2 ;a 4 ;a 9 ;a 11 g. \\nWe’ll see how to solve this problem, proceeding in several steps.

De- \\nnote by S ij the set of activities that start after activity a i ûnishes and that ûnish \\nbefore activity a j starts. Suppose that you want to ûnd a maximum set of mutually \\ncompatible activities in S ij , and suppose further that such a maximum set is A ij , \\nwhich includes some activity a k . By including a k in an optimal solution, you are \\nleft with two subproblems: ûnding mutually compatible activities in the set S ik \\n(activities that start after activity a i ûnishes and that ûnish before activity a k starts) \\nand ûnding mutually compatible activities in the set S kj (activities that start after \\nactivity a k ûnishes and that ûnish before activity a j starts). Let A ik D A ij \\\\ S ik \\nand A kj D A ij \\\\ S kj , so that A ik contains the activities in A ij that ûnish before a k \\nstarts and A kj contains the activities in A ij that start after a k ûnishes. Thus, we \\nhave A ij D A ik [ fa k g [ A kj , and so the maximum-size set A ij of mutually com- \\npatible activities in S ij consists of jA ij j D jA ik j C jA kj j C 1 activities. \\nThe usual cut-and-paste argument shows that an optimal solution A ij must also \\ninclude optimal solutions to the two subproblems fo r S ik and S kj . If you could \\nûnd a set A 0 \\nkj of mutually compatible activities in S kj where jA 0 \\nkj j > jA kj j, then \\nyou could use A 0 \\nkj , rather than A kj , in a solution to the subproblem for S ij .

That could save you from having to consider all \\nthe choices inherent in recurrence (15.2). In fact, for the activity-selection problem, \\nyou need to consider only one choice: the greedy choice. \\nWhat is the greedy choice for the activity-selection problem? Intuition suggests \\nthat you should choose an activity that leaves the resource available for as many \\nother activities as possible. Of the activities you end up choosing, one of them \\nmust be the ûrst one to ûnish. Intuition says, therefore, choose the activity in S \\nwith the earliest ûnish time, since that leaves the resource available for as many \\nof the activities that follow it as possible. (If m ore than one activity in S has \\nthe earliest ûnish time, then choose any such activity.) In other words, since the \\nactivities are sorted in monotonically increasing o rder by ûnish time, the greedy \\nchoice is activity a 1 . Choosing the ûrst activity to ûnish is not the only way to \\nthink of making a greedy choice for this problem. Exercise 15.1-3 asks you to \\nexplore other possibilities. \\nOnce you make the greedy choice, you have only one remaining subproblem to \\nsolve: ûnding activities that start after a 1 ûnishes. Why don’t you have to consider \\nactivities that ûnish before a 1 starts? Because s 1 < f 1 , and because f 1 is the \\nearliest ûnish time of any activity, no activity can have a ûnish time less than or \\nequal to s 1 . Thus, all activities that are compatible with act ivity a 1 must start \\nafter a 1 ûnishes. \\nFurthermore, we have already established that the activity-selection problem ex- \\nhibits optimal substructure. Let S k D fa i 2 S W s i \\ue004 f k g be the set of activities that \\nstart after activity a k ûnishes. If you make the greedy choice of activity a 1 , then \\nS 1 remains as the only subproblem to solve. 1 Optimal substructure says that if a 1 \\nbelongs to an optimal solution, then an optimal sol ution to the original problem \\nconsists of activity a 1 and all the activities in an optimal solution to the subprob- \\nlem S 1 . \\nOne big question remains: Is this intuition correct? Is the greedy choice4in \\nwhich you choose the ûrst activity to ûnish4always part of some optimal solution? \\nThe following theorem shows that it is. \\n1 We sometimes refer to the sets S k as subproblems rather than as just sets of activities. The context \\nwill make it clear whether we are referring to S k as a set of activities or as a subproblem whose input \\nis that set. '),\n",

Instead, you can repeat- \\nedly choose the activity that ûnishes ûrst, keep only the activities compatible with \\nthis activity, and repeat until no activities remai n. Moreover, because you always \\nchoose the activity with the earliest ûnish time, the ûnish times of the activities that \\nyou choose must strictly increase. You can consider each activity just once overall, \\nin monotonically increasing order of ûnish times. \\nAn algorithm to solve the activity-selection problem does not need to work \\nbottom-up, like a table-based dynamic-programming algorithm. Instead, it can \\nwork top-down, choosing an activity to put into the optimal solution that it con- \\nstructs and then solving the subproblem of choosing  activities from those that are \\ncompatible with those already chosen.

At each decision point, the algorithm makes the choice that seems best \\nat the moment. This heuristic strategy does not always produce an optimal solution, \\nbut as in the activity-selection problem, sometimes it does. This section discusses \\nsome of the general properties of greedy methods. \\nThe process that we followed in Section 15.1 to develop a greedy algorithm was \\na bit more involved than is typical. It consisted of the following steps: \\n1. Determine the optimal substructure of the problem. \\n2. Develop a recursive solution. (For the activity-selection problem, we formu- \\nlated recurrence (15.2), but bypassed developing a recursive algorithm based \\nsolely on this recurrence.) \\n3. Show that if you make the greedy choice, then only one subproblem remains. \\n4. Prove that it is always safe to make the greedy choice. (Steps 3 and 4 can occur \\nin either order.) \\n5. Develop a recursive algorithm that implements the greedy strategy. \\n6. Convert the recursive algorithm to an iterative algorithm. \\nThese steps highlighted in great detail the dynamic-programming underpinnings \\nof a greedy algorithm. For example, the ûrst cut at the activity-selection problem \\ndeûned the subproblems S ij , where both i and j varied. We then found that if \\nyou always make the greedy choice, you can restrict the subproblems to be of the \\nform S k . \\nAn alternative approach is to fashion optimal substructure with a greedy choice \\nin mind, so that the choice leaves just one subprob lem to solv e. In the activity- \\nselection problem, start by dropping the second subscript and deûning subproblems \\nof the form S k . Then prove that a greedy choice (the ûrst activity a m to ûnish \\nin S k ), combined with an optimal solution to the remaini ng set S m of compatible \\nactivities, yields an optimal solution to S k . More generally, you can design greedy \\nalgorithms according to the following sequence of steps: \\n1. Cast the optimization problem as one in which you make a choice and are left \\nwith one subproblem to solve. \\n2. Prove that there is always an optimal solution to the original problem that makes \\nthe greedy choice, so that the greedy choice is always safe. \\n3.

Nevertheless, be- \\nneath every greedy algorithm, there is almost always a more cumbersome dynamic- \\nprogramming solution. \\nHow can you tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular optimization \\nproblem? No way works all the time, but the greedy-choice property and optimal \\nsubstructure are the two key ingredients. If you ca n demonstrate that the problem \\nhas these properties, then you are well on the way to developing a greedy algorithm \\nfor it. \\nGreedy-choice property \\nThe ûrst key ingredient is the \\ngreedy-choice property: you can assemble a globally \\noptimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices. In other words, when \\nyou are considering which choice to make, you make the choice that looks best in \\nthe current problem, without considering results from subproblems. \\nHere is where greedy algorithms differ from dynamic programming. In dynamic \\nprogramming, you make a choice at each step, but th e choice usually depends \\non the solutions to subproblems. Consequently, you typically solve dynamic- \\nprogramming problems in a bottom-up manner, progressing from smaller sub- \\nproblems to larger subproblems. (Alternatively, you  can solve them top down, \\nbut memoizing. Of course, even though the code works top down, you still must \\nsolve the subproblems before making a choice.) In a  greedy algorithm, you make \\nwhatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblem that re- \\nmains. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices so far, but it \\ncannot depend on any future choices or on the solutions to subproblems. Thus, un- \\nlike dynamic programming, which solves the subproblems before making the ûrst \\nchoice, a greedy algorithm makes its ûrst choice before solving any subproblems. \\nA dynamic-programming algorithm proceeds bottom up, whereas a greedy strat- \\negy usually progresses top down, making one greedy choice after another, reducing \\neach given problem instance to a smaller one. \\nOf course, you need to prove that a greedy choice at each step yields a globally \\noptimal solution. Typically, as in the case of Theorem 15.1, the proof examines \\na globally optimal solution to some subproblem. It then shows how to modify \\nthe solution to substitute the greedy choice for some other choice, resulting in one \\nsimilar, but smaller, subproblem. \\nYou can usually make the greedy choice more efûciently than when you have \\nto consider a wider set of choices. For example, in  the activity-selection problem, \\nassuming that the activities were already sorted in monotonically increasing order \\nby ûnish times, each activity needed to be examined just once. By preprocessing '),\n",

This \\nproperty is a key ingredient of assessing whether d ynamic programming applies, \\nand it’s also essential for greedy algorithms. As an example of optimal substruc- \\nture, recall how Section 15.1 demonstrated that if an optimal solution to subprob- \\nlem S ij includes an activity a k , then it must also contain optimal solutions to th e \\nsubproblems S ik and S kj . Given this optimal substructure, we argued that if you \\nknow which activity to use as a k , you can construct an optimal solution to S ij by \\nselecting a k along with all activities in optimal solutions to t he subproblems S ik \\nand S kj . This observation of optimal substructure gave rise to the recurrence (15.2) \\nthat describes the value of an optimal solution. \\nYou will usually use a more direct approach regarding optimal substructure when \\napplying it to greedy algorithms. As mentioned abov e, you have the luxury of \\nassuming that you arrived at a subproblem by having  made the greedy choice in \\nthe original problem. All you really need to do is argue that an optimal solution to \\nthe subproblem, combined with the greedy choice already made, yields an optimal \\nsolution to the original problem. This scheme impli citly uses induction on the \\nsubproblems to prove that making the greedy choice at every step produces an \\noptimal solution. \\nGreedy versus dynamic programming \\nBecause both the greedy and dynamic-programming strategies exploit optimal sub- \\nstructure, you might be tempted to generate a dynamic-programming solution to \\na problem when a greedy solution sufûces or, conversely, you might mistakenly \\nthink that a greedy solution works when in fact a dynamic-programming solution \\nis required. To illustrate the subtle differences b etween the two techniques, let’s \\ninvestigate two variants of a classical optimization problem. \\nThe \\n0-1 knapsack problem is the following. A thief robbing a store wants to \\ntake the most valuable load that can be carried in a knapsack capable of carrying \\nat most W pounds of loot. The thief can choose to take any su bset of n items in \\nthe store. The i th item is worth v i dollars and weighs w i pounds, where v i and w i \\nare integers. Which items should the thief take? (We call this the 0-1 knapsack \\nproblem because for each item, the thief must either take it or leave it behind. The \\nthief cannot take a fractional amount of an item or take an item more than once.) '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\rokig\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\Algo Generator\\\\data\\\\cormen book.pdf', 'page': 450}, page_content='15.2 Elements of the greedy strategy 429 \\nIn the fractional knapsack problem, the setup is the same, but the thief can take \\nfractions of items, rather than having to make a binary (0-1) choice for each item. \\nYou can think of an item in the 0-1 knapsack problem as being like a gold ingot \\nand an item in the fractional knapsack problem as more like gold dust. \\nBoth knapsack problems exhibit the optimal-substructure property. For the 0-1 \\nproblem, if the most valuable load weighing at most  W pounds includes item j , \\nthen the remaining load must be the most valuable load weighing at most W \\ue003 w j \\npounds that the thief can take from the n \\ue003 1 original items excluding item j . For \\nthe comparable fractional problem, if if the most v aluable load weighing at most \\nW pounds includes weight w of item j , then the remaining load must be the most \\nvaluable load weighing at most W \\ue003 w pounds that the thief can take from the n \\ue003 1 \\noriginal items plus w j \\ue003 w pounds of item j . \\nAlthough the problems are similar, a greedy strateg y works t o solve the frac- \\ntional knapsack problem, but not the 0-1 problem. To solve the fractional problem, \\nûrst compute the value per pound v i =w i for each item. Obeying a greedy strategy, \\nthe thief begins by taking as much as possible of t he item with the greatest value \\nper pound. If the supply of that item is exhausted and the thief can still carry more, \\nthen the thief takes as much as possible of the item with the next greatest value per \\npound, and so forth, until reaching the weight limit W . Thus, by sorting the items \\nby value per pound, the greedy algorithm runs in O.n lg n/ time. You are asked \\nto prove that the fractional knapsack problem has t he greedy -choice property in \\nExercise 15.2-1. \\nTo see that this greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem, \\nconsider the problem instance illustrated in Figure 15.3(a). This example has three \\nitems and a knapsack that can hold 50 pounds. Item 1 weighs 10 pounds and is \\nworth $60. Item 2 weighs 20 pounds and is worth $100. Item 3 weighs 30 pounds \\nand is worth $120. Thus, the value per pound of item 1 is $6 per pound, which is \\ngreater than the value per pound of either item 2 ($5 per pound) or item 3 ($4 per \\npound). The greedy strategy, therefore, would take item 1 ûrst. As you can see \\nfrom the case analysis in Figure 15.3(b), however, the optimal solution takes items \\n2 and 3, leaving item 1 behind. The two possible solutions that take item 1 are both \\nsuboptimal. \\nFor the comparable fractional problem, however, the  greedy strategy, which \\ntakes item 1 ûrst, does yield an optimal solution, as shown in Figure 15.3(c). Tak- \\ning item 1 doesn’t work in the 0-1 problem, because the thief is unable to ûll the \\nknapsack to capacity, and the empty space lowers the effective value per pound of \\nthe load. In the 0-1 problem, when you consider whether to include an item in the \\nknapsack, you must compare the solution to the subproblem that includes the item \\nwith the solution to the subproblem that excludes the item before you can make the \\nchoice. The problem formulated in this way gives ri se to many overlapping sub- '),\n",

Since no code- \\nword is a preûx of any other, the codeword that begins an encoded ûle is unambigu- \\nous. You can simply identify the initial codeword, translate it back to the original \\ncharacter, and repeat the decoding process on the r emainder of the encoded ûle. \\nIn our example, the string 100011001101 parses uniquely as 100 \\ue001 0 \\ue001 1100 \\ue001 1101, \\nwhich decodes to cafe.

(b) The tree corresponding \\nto the optimal preûx-free code a = 0, b = 101, c = 100, d = 111, e = 1101, f = 1100. \\nThe decoding process needs a convenient representation for the preûx-free code \\nso that you can easily pick off the initial codewor d. A binary tree whose leaves \\nare the given characters provides one such represen tation. Interpret the binary \\ncodeword for a character as the simple path from the root to that character, where 0 \\nmeans <go to the left child= and 1 means <go to the right child.= Figure 15.5 shows \\nthe trees for the two codes of our example. Note th at these are not binary search \\ntrees, since the leaves need not appear in sorted o rder and internal nodes do not \\ncontain character keys. \\nAn optimal code for a ûle is always represented by a full binary tree, in which \\nevery nonleaf node has two children (see Exercise 15.3-2). The ûxed-length code \\nin our example is not optimal since its tree, shown in Figure 15.5(a), is not a full \\nbinary tree: it contains codewords beginning with 10, but none beginning with 11. \\nSince we can now restrict our attention to full binary trees, we can say that if C is \\nthe alphabet from which the characters are drawn and all character frequencies are \\npositive, then the tree for an optimal preûx-free code has exactly jC j leaves, one for \\neach letter of the alphabet, and exactly jC j \\ue003 1 internal nodes (see Exercise B.5-3 \\non page 1175). \\nGiven a tree T corresponding to a preûx-free code, we can compute the number \\nof bits required to encode a ûle. For each character c in the alphabet C , let the \\nattribute c: freq denote the frequency of c in the ûle and let d T .c/ denote the depth \\nof c ’s leaf in the tree. Note that d T .c/ is also the length of the codeword for \\ncharacter c . The number of bits required to encode a ûle is thus '),\n",

In such a tree, the codeword s for x and y have the same \\nlength and differ only in the last bit. \\nLet a and b be any two characters that are sibling leaves of ma ximum depth \\nin T .

A cache organizes data into \\ncache blocks typically comprising 32, 64, or 128 bytes. You can also think of main \\nmemory as a cache for disk-resident data in a virtual-memory system. Here, the \\nblocks are called pages, and 4096 bytes is a typical size. \\nAs a computer program executes, it makes a sequence of memory requests. Say \\nthat there are n memory requests, to data in blocks b 1 ;b 2 ;:::;b  n , in that order. The \\nblocks in the access sequence might not be distinct, and indeed, any given block is \\nusually accessed multiple times. For example, a program that accesses four distinct \\nblocks p;q;r;s  might make a sequence of requests to blocks s;q;s;q;q;s;p;p;r;  \\ns;s;q;p;r;q . The cache can hold up to some ûxed number k of cache blocks. It \\nstarts out empty before the ûrst request. Each request causes at most one block to \\nenter the cache and at most one block to be evicted from the cache. Upon a request \\nfor block b i , any one of three scenarios may occur: \\n1. Block b i is already in the cache, due to a previous request for the same block. \\nThe cache remains unchanged. This situation is known as a cache hit. \\n2. Block b i is not in the cache at that time, but the cache con tains fewer than k \\nblocks. In this case, block b i is placed into the cache, so that the cache contains \\none more block than it did before the request. \\n3. Block b i is not in the cache at that time and the cache is f ull: it contains k \\nblocks. Block b i is placed into the cache, but before that happens, some other \\nblock in the cache must be evicted from the cache in order to make room. \\nThe latter two situations, in which the requested block is not already in the cache, \\nare called cache misses. The goal is to minimize the number of cache misse s or, \\nequivalently, to maximize the number of cache hits, over the entire sequence of n \\nrequests. A cache miss that occurs while the cache holds fewer than k blocks4 \\nthat is, as the cache is ûrst being ûlled up4is known as a compulsory miss, since \\nno prior decision could have kept the requested block in the cache. When a cache \\nmiss occurs and the cache is full, ideally the choice of which block to evict should \\nallow for the smallest possible number of cache misses over the entire sequence of \\nfuture requests. \\nTypically, caching is an online problem. That is, t he computer has to decide \\nwhich blocks to keep in the cache without knowing t he future requests. Here, \\nhowever, let’s consider the ofüine version of this problem, in which the computer \\nknows in advance the entire sequence of n requests and the cache size k, with a \\ngoal of minimizing the total number of cache misses.

Intuitively, this strategy makes sense: \\nif you’re not going to need something for a while, why keep it around? We’ll show \\nthat the furthest-in-future strategy is indeed optimal by showing that the ofüine \\ncaching problem exhibits optimal substructure and t hat furthest-in-future has the \\ngreedy-choice property. \\nNow, you might be thinking that since the computer usually doesn’t know the \\nsequence of requests in advance, there is no point in studying the ofüine problem. \\nActually, there is. In some situations, you do know  the sequence of requests in \\nadvance. For example, if you view the main memory a s the cache and the full set \\nof data as residing on disk (or a solid-state drive), there are algorithms that plan out \\nthe entire set of reads and writes in advance. Furthermore, we can use the number \\nof cache misses produced by an optimal algorithm as a baseline for comparing how \\nwell online algorithms perform. We’ll do just that in Section 27.3. \\nOfüine caching can even model real-world problems. For example, consider a \\nscenario where you know in advance a ûxed schedule of n events at known loca- \\ntions. Events may occur at a location multiple times, not necessarily consecutively. \\nYou are managing a group of k agents, you need to ensure that you have one agent \\nat each location when an event occurs, and you want  to minimize the number of \\ntimes that agents have to move. Here, the agents are like the blocks, the events are \\nlike the requests, and moving an agent is akin to a cache miss. \\nOptimal substructure of ofüine caching \\nTo show that the ofüine problem exhibits optimal substructure, let’s deûne the \\nsubproblem .C;i/ as processing requests for blocks b i ;b i C1 ;:::;b  n with cache \\nconûguration C at the time that the request for block b i occurs, that is, C is a \\nsubset of the set of blocks such that jC j හ k.

We’ll show how to construct S 0 with the following properties: \\n1. For j D i C 1;:::;m , let D j D C S;j \\\\ C S 0 ;j . Then, jD j j \\ue004 k \\ue003 1, so that the \\ncache conûgurations C S;j and C S 0 ;j differ by at most one block. If they differ, \\nthen C S;j D D j [ f´g and C S 0 ;j D D j [ fy g for some block y ¤ ´. \\n2. For each request of blocks b i ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 , if solution S has a cache hit, then \\nsolution S 0 also has a cache hit. \\n3. For all j >m, the cache conûgurations C S;j and C S 0 ;j are identical. \\n4. Over the sequence of requests for blocks b i ;:::;b  m , the number of cache misses \\nproduced by solution S 0 is at most the number of cache misses produced by so- \\nlution S . \\nWe’ll prove inductively that these properties hold for each request. \\n1. We proceed by induction on j , for j D i C 1;:::;m . For the base case, the ini- \\ntial caches C S;i and C S 0 ;i are identical. Upon the request for block b i , solution S \\nevicts x and solution S 0 evicts ´. Thus, cache conûgurations C S;i C1 and C S 0 ;i C1 \\ndiffer by just one block, C S;i C1 D D i C1 [ f´g, C S 0 ;i C1 D D i C1 [ fx g, and \\nx ¤ ´. \\nThe inductive step deûnes how solution S 0 behaves upon a request for block b j \\nfor i C 1 හ j හ m \\ue003 1. The inductive hypothesis is that property 1 holds when \\nb j is requested. Because ´ D b m is the block in C S;i whose next reference is \\nfurthest in the future, we know that b j ¤ ´. We consider several scenarios: \\n\\ue001 If C S;j D C S 0 ;j (so that jD j j D k), then solution S 0 makes the same decision \\nupon the request for b j as S makes, so that C S;j C1 D C S 0 ;j C1 . \\n\\ue001 If jD j j D  k \\ue003 1 and b j 2 D j , then both caches already contain block b j , \\nand both solutions S and S 0 have cache hits. Therefore, C S;j C1 D C S;j and \\nC S 0 ;j C1 D C S 0 ;j . \\n\\ue001 If jD j j D k \\ue003 1 and b j … D j , then because C S;j D D j [ f´g and b j ¤ ´, \\nsolution S has a cache miss.

Once again, there are two cases, depending on whether b j D y : \\n˘ If b j D y , then solution S 0 has a cache hit, so that C S 0 ;j C1 D \\nC S 0 ;j D D j [ fb j g. Since w 2 D j and w was not evicted by solu- \\ntion S 0 , we have w 2 C S 0 ;j C1 . Therefore, w … D j C1 and b j 2 D j C1 , \\nso that D j C1 D .D j \\ue003 fwg/ [ fb j g. Thus, C S;j C1 D D j C1 [ f´g, \\nC S 0 ;j C1 D D j C1 [ fwg, and because w ¤ ´, property 1 holds when \\nblock b j C1 is requested. (In other words, block w replaces block y \\nin property 1.) \\n˘ If b j ¤ y , then solution S 0 has a cache miss. It evicts block w, \\nso that C S 0 ;j C1 D .D j \\ue003 fwg/ [ fb j ;y g.

In the above discussion about maintaining property 1, solution S may have a \\ncache hit in only the ûrst two cases, and solution S 0 has a cache hit in these \\ncases if and only if S does. \\n3. If C S;m D C S 0 ;m , then solution S 0 makes the same decision upon the request for \\nblock ´ D b m as S makes, so that C S;mC1 D C S 0 ;mC1 . If C S;m ¤ C S 0 ;m , then by \\nproperty 1, C S;m D D m [f´g and C S 0 ;m D D m [fy g, where y ¤ ´. In this case, \\nsolution S has a cache hit, so that C S;mC1 D C S;m D D m [ f´g. Solution S 0 \\nevicts block y and brings in block ´, so that C S 0 ;mC1 D D m [ f´g D C S;mC1 . \\nThus, regardless of whether or not C S;m D C S 0 ;m , we have C S;mC1 D C S 0 ;mC1 , \\nand starting with the request for block b mC1 , solution S 0 simply makes the same \\ndecisions as S . \\n4. By property 2, upon the requests for blocks b i ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 , whenever solution S \\nhas a cache hit, so does S 0 . Only the request for block b m D ´ remains to be \\nconsidered. If S has a cache miss upon the request for b m , then regardless of \\nwhether S 0 has a cache hit or a cache miss, we are done: S 0 has at most the \\nsame number of cache misses as S . \\nSo now suppose that S has a cache hit and S 0 has a cache miss upon the re- \\nquest for b m . We’ll show that there exists a request for at least one of blocks \\nb i C1 ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 in which the request results in a cache miss for S and a cache hit \\nfor S 0 , thereby compensating for what happens upon the re quest for block b m . \\nThe proof is by contradiction. Assume that no request for blocks b i C1 ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 \\nresults in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S 0 . \\nWe start by observing that once the caches C S;j and C S 0 j are equal for some \\nj > i , they remain equal thereafter. Observe also that if b m 2 C S;m and \\nb m … C S 0 ;m , then C S;m ¤ C S 0 ;m . Therefore, solution S cannot have evicted \\nblock ´ upon the requests for blocks b i ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 , for if it had, then these two '),\n",

The remaining possibility is that upon \\neach of these requests, we had C S;j D D j [ f´g, C S 0 ;j D D j [ fy g for some \\nblock y ¤ ´, and solution S evicted some block w 2 D j . Moreover, since none \\nof these requests resulted in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S 0 , the case of \\nb j D y never occurred. That is, for every request of blocks b i C1 ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 , the \\nrequested block b j was never the block y 2 C S 0 ;j \\ue003 C S;j . In these cases, after \\nprocessing the request, we had C S 0 ;j C1 D D j C1 [ fy g: the difference between \\nthe two caches did not change. Now, let’s go back to the request for block b i , \\nwhere afterward, we had C S 0 ;i C1 D D i C1 [ fx g. Because every succeeding \\nrequest until requesting block b m did not change the difference between the \\ncaches, we had C S 0 ;j D D j [ fx g for j D i C 1;:::;m . \\nBy deûnition, block ´ D b m is requested after block x . That means at least \\none of blocks b i C1 ;:::;b  m\\ue0021 is block x . But for j D i C 1;:::;m , we have \\nx 2 C S 0 ;j and x … C S;j , so that at least one of these requests had a cach e hit \\nfor S 0 and a cache miss for S , a contradiction. We conclude that if solution S \\nhas a cache hit and solution S 0 has a cache miss upon the request for block b m , \\nthen some earlier request had the opposite result, and so solution S 0 produces \\nno more cache misses than solution S . Since S is assumed to be optimal, S 0 is \\noptimal as well. \\nAlong with the optimal-substructure property, Theorem 15.5 tells us that the \\nfurthest-in-future strategy yields the minimum number of cache misses. \\nExercises \\n15.4-1 \\nWrite pseudocode for a cache manager that uses the furthest-in-future strategy. It \\nshould take as input a set C of blocks in the cache, the number of blocks k that the \\ncache can hold, a sequence b 1 ;b 2 ;:::;b  n of requested blocks, and the index i into \\nthe sequence for the block b i being requested. For each request, it should print out \\nwhether a cache hit or cache miss occurs, and for e ach cache miss, it should also \\nprint out which block, if any, is evicted. \\n15.4-2 \\nReal cache managers do not know the future requests , and so they often use the \\npast to decide which block to evict. The \\nleast-recently-used, or LRU, strategy \\nevicts the block that, of all blocks currently in t he cache, was the least recently \\nrequested. (You can think of LRU as <furthest-in-past.=) Give an example of a \\nrequest sequence in which the LRU strategy is not o ptimal, by showing that it \\ninduces more cache misses than the furthest-in-future strategy does on the same \\nrequest sequence.

Let C i be the completion time of task a i , that is, the \\ntime at which task a i completes processing. Your goal is to minimize the average \\ncompletion time, that is, to minimize .1=n/ P n \\ni D1 C i . For example, suppose that \\nthere are two tasks a 1 and a 2 with p 1 D 3 and p 2 D 5, and consider the schedule '),\n",

It might then resume at time 10 but be \\npreempted at time 11, and it might ûnally resume at time 13 and complete at \\ntime 15.

Buff charges a membership fee of $ 60 per \\nmonth, plus $ 3 for every time you use the gym. Because you are dis ciplined, \\nyou visit Buff’s Gym every day during the month of November. On top of the \\n$60 monthly charge for November, you pay another 3 \\ue005 $30 D $90 that month. \\nAlthough you can think of your fees as a üat fee of $60 and another $90 in daily \\nfees, you can think about it in another way. All to gether, you pay $ 150 over 30 \\ndays, or an average of $5 per day. When you look at your fees in this way, you are \\namortizing the monthly fee over the 30 days of the month, spreading it out at $ 2 \\nper day. \\nYou can do the same thing when you analyze running times. In an amortized \\nanalysis, you average the time required to perform a sequence of data-structure \\noperations over all the operations performed. With amortized analysis, you show \\nthat if you average over a sequence of operations, then the average cost of an oper- \\nation is small, even though a single operation within the sequence might be expen- \\nsive. Amortized analysis differs from average-case analysis in that probability is \\nnot involved. An amortized analysis guarantees the average performance of each \\noperation in the worst case. \\nThe ûrst three sections of this chapter cover the three most common techniques \\nused in amortized analysis. Section 16.1 starts with aggregate analysis, in which \\nyou determine an upper bound T.n/ on the total cost of a sequence of n operations. \\nThe average cost per operation is then T.n/=n. You take the average cost as the \\namortized cost of each operation, so that all opera tions have the same amortized \\ncost. \\nSection 16.2 covers the accounting method, in which you determine an amor- \\ntized cost of each operation.

Later in the sequence, the \\ncredit pays for operations that are charged less than they actually cost. \\nSection 16.3 discusses the potential method, which is like the accounting method \\nin that you determine the amortized cost of each operation and may overcharge op- \\nerations early on to compensate for undercharges later. The potential method main- \\ntains the credit as the <potential energy= of the data structure as a whole instead of \\nassociating the credit with individual objects within the data structure. \\nWe’ll use use two examples in this chapter to examine each of these three meth- \\nods. One is a stack with the additional operation MULTIPOP, which pops several \\nobjects at once. The other is a binary counter that  counts up from 0 by means of \\nthe single operation I NCREMENT . \\nWhile reading this chapter, bear in mind that the c harges assigned during an \\namortized analysis are for analysis purposes only. They need not4and should not \\n4appear in the code. If, for example, you assign a credit to an object x when using \\nthe accounting method, you have no need to assign an appropriate amount to some \\nattribute, such as x: credit , in the code. \\nWhen you perform an amortized analysis, you often gain insight into a particular \\ndata structure, and this insight can help you optim ize the design. For example, \\nSection 16.4 will use the potential method to analyze a dynamically expanding and \\ncontracting table. \\n16.1 Aggregate analysis \\nIn aggregate analysis, you show that for all n, a sequence of n operations takes \\nT.n/ worst-case time in total. In the worst case, the average cost, or amortized cost, \\nper operation is therefore T.n/=n. This amortized cost applies to each operation, \\neven when there are several types of operations in the sequence. The other two \\nmethods we shall study in this chapter, the account ing method and the potential \\nmethod, may assign different amortized costs to different types of operations. \\nStack operations \\nAs the ûrst example of aggregate analysis, let’s analyze stacks that have been aug- \\nmented with a new operation. Section 10.1.3 presented the two fundamental stack \\noperations, each of which takes O.1/ time: \\nPUSH .S;x/ pushes object x onto stack S . \\nPOP.S/ pops the top of stack S and returns the popped object. Calling P OP on an \\nempty stack generates an error. '),\n",

The next operation is M ULTIPOP.S;7/, \\nwhich empties the stack4shown in (c)4since fewer than 7 objects remained. \\nSince each of these operations runs in O.1/ time, let us consider the cost of each \\nto be 1. The total cost of a sequence of n PUSH and POP operations is therefore n, \\nand the actual running time for n operations is therefore ‚.n/. \\nNow let’s add the stack operation MULTIPOP .S;k/, which removes the k top ob- \\njects of stack S , popping the entire stack if the stack contains fewer than k objects. \\nOf course, the procedure assumes that k is positive, and otherwise, the MULTIPOP \\noperation leaves the stack unchanged. In the pseudo code for M ULTIPOP, the op- \\neration STAC K-EMPTY returns TRUE if there are no objects currently on the stack, \\nand FALSE otherwise.

The number of iterations of the while loop is the number min fs;kg \\nof objects popped off the stack. Each iteration of the loop makes one call to POP in \\nline 2. Thus, the total cost of M ULTIPOP is min fs;kg, and the actual running time \\nis a linear function of this cost. \\nNow let’s analyze a sequence of n PUSH , POP, and M ULTIPOP operations on \\nan initially empty stack. The worst-case cost of a MULTIPOP operation in the \\nsequence is O.n/, since the stack size is at most n. The worst-case time of any stack \\noperation is therefore O.n/, and hence a sequence of n operations costs O.n 2 /, \\nsince the sequence contains at most n MULTIPOP operations costing O.n/ each.

The amount that you charge an operation is its amortized cost. When \\nan operation’s amortized cost exceeds its actual cost, you assign the difference to \\nspeciûc objects in the data structure as credit. Credit can help pay for later oper- \\nations whose amortized cost is less than their actu al cost. Thus, you can view the \\namortized cost of an operation as being split between its actual cost and credit that \\nis either deposited or used up. Different operation s may have different amortized \\ncosts.

Moreover, as \\nin aggregate analysis, the upper bound must apply t o all sequences of operations. \\nLet’s denote the actual cost of the i th operation by c i and the amortized cost of the \\ni th operation by y c i . Then you need to have \\nn X \\ni D1 \\ny c i \\ue004 \\nn X \\ni D1 \\nc i (16.1) \\nfor all sequences of n operations. The total credit stored in the data str ucture \\nis the difference between the total amortized cost and the total actual cost, or P n \\ni D1 y c i \\ue003 P n \\ni D1 c i . By inequality (16.1), the total credit associated with the data \\nstructure must be nonnegative at all times. If you ever allowed the total credit to \\nbecome negative (the result of undercharging early operations with the promise of \\nrepaying the account later on), then the total amor tized costs incurred at that time \\nwould be below the total actual costs incurred. In that case, for the sequence of \\noperations up to that time, the total amortized cos t would not be an upper bound \\non the total actual cost. Thus, you must take care that the total credit in the data \\nstructure never becomes negative. \\nStack operations \\nTo illustrate the accounting method of amortized an alysis, we return to the stack \\nexample. Recall that the actual costs of the operations were \\nPUSH 1, \\nPOP 1, \\nMULTIPOP min fs;kg , \\nwhere k is the argument supplied to M ULTIPOP and s is the stack size when it is \\ncalled. Let us assign the following amortized costs: \\nPUSH 2 , \\nPOP 0 , \\nMULTIPOP 0 . \\nThe amortized cost of MULTIPOP is a constant (0), whereas the actual cost is vari- \\nable, and thus all three amortized costs are consta nt. In general, the amortized \\ncosts of the operations under consideration may dif fer from each other, and they \\nmay even differ asymptotically. \\nNow let’s see how to pay for any sequence of stack operations by charging the \\namortized costs. Let $ 1 represent each unit of cost. At ûrst, the stack is empty. \\nRecall the analogy of Section 10.1.3 between the stack data structure and a stack \\nof plates in a cafeteria.

Place that $1 \\nof credit on top of the plate. At any point in time , every plate on the stack has $ 1 \\nof credit on it. \\nThe $1 stored on the plate serves to prepay the cost of po pping the plate from \\nthe stack. A POP operation incurs no charge: pay the actual cost of popping a plate \\nby taking the $ 1 of credit off the plate. Thus, by charging the P USH operation a \\nlittle bit more, we can view the POP operation as free. \\nMoreover, the MULTIPOP operation also incurs no charge, since it’s just repeated \\nPOP operations, each of which is free. If a MULTIPOP operation pops k plates, then \\nthe actual cost is paid by the k dollars stored on the k plates. Because each plate \\non the stack has $1 of credit on it, and the stack always has a nonnegative number \\nof plates, the amount of credit is always nonnegative. Thus, for any sequence of n \\nPUSH , POP, and MULTIPOP operations, the total amortized cost is an upper bound \\non the total actual cost. Since the total amortized cost is O.n/, so is the total actual \\ncost. \\nIncrementing a binary counter \\nAs another illustration of the accounting method, let’s analyze the I NCREMENT \\noperation on a binary counter that starts at 0. Recall that the running time of this \\noperation is proportional to the number of bits üipped, which serves as the cost for \\nthis example. Again, we’ll use $1 to represent each unit of cost (the üipping of a \\nbit in this example). \\nFor the amortized analysis, the amortized cost to s et a 0-bit to 1 is $2. When a \\nbit is set to 1, $1 of the $2 pays to actually set the bit. The second $1 resides on the \\nbit as credit to be used later if and when the bit is reset to 0. At any point in time, \\nevery 1-bit in the counter has $1 of credit on it, and thus resetting a bit to 0 can be \\nviewed as costing nothing, and the $1 on the bit prepays for the reset. \\nHere is how to determine the amortized cost of I NCREMENT . The cost of reset- \\nting the bits to 0 within the while loop is paid for by the dollars on the bits that are \\nreset. The I NCREMENT procedure sets at most one bit to 1, in line 6, and there- \\nfore the amortized cost of an I NCREMENT operation is at most $2. The number of \\n1-bits in the counter never becomes negative, and thus the amount of credit stays \\nnonnegative at all times. Thus, for n I NCREMENT operations, the total amortized \\ncost is O.n/, which bounds the total actual cost. \\nExercises \\n16.2-1 \\nYou perform a sequence of PUSH and POP operations on a stack whose size never \\nexceeds k.

(Hint: Keep a \\npointer to the high-order 1.) \\n16.3 The potential method \\nInstead of representing prepaid work as credit stor ed with s peciûc objects in the \\ndata structure, the potential method of amortized analysis represents the prepaid \\nwork as <potential energy,= or just <potential,= wh ich can be released to pay for \\nfuture operations. The potential applies to the data structure as a whole rather than \\nto speciûc objects within the data structure. \\nThe potential method works as follows. Starting with an initial data structure D 0 , \\na sequence of n operations occurs. For each i D 1;2;:::;n , let c i be the actual \\ncost of the i th operation and D i be the data structure that results after applying \\nthe i th operation to data structure D i \\ue0021 . A potential function ˆ maps each data \\nstructure D i to a real number ˆ.D i /, which is the potential associated with D i . \\nThe amortized cost y c i of the i th operation with respect to potential function ˆ is \\ndeûned by \\ny c i D c i C ˆ.D i / \\ue003 ˆ.D i \\ue0021 /: (16.2) \\nThe amortized cost of each operation is therefore its actual cost plus the change in \\npotential due to the operation.

It’s usually simplest to just \\ndeûne ˆ.D 0 / to be 0 and then show that ˆ.D i / \\ue004 0 for all i .

The load factor ˛.T/ of a nonempty table T is deûned as the number \\nof items stored in the table divided by the size (n umber of slots) of the table. An \\nempty table (one with no slots) has size 0, and its load factor is deûned to be 1. If \\nthe load factor of a dynamic table is bounded below by a constant, the unused space \\nin the table is never more than a constant fraction of the total amount of space. \\nWe start by analyzing a dynamic table that allows only insertion and then move \\non to the more general case that supports both insertion and deletion. \\n16.4.1 Table expansion \\nLet’s assume that storage for a table is allocated as an array of slots. A table ûlls up \\nwhen all slots have been used or, equivalently, when its load factor is 1. 1 In some \\nsoftware environments, upon an attempt to insert an item into a full table, the only \\nalternative is to abort with an error. The scenario  in this se ction assumes, how- \\never, that the software environment, like many modern ones, provides a memory- \\nmanagement system that can allocate and free blocks of storage on request. Thus, \\nupon inserting an item into a full table, the syste m can expand the table by allo- \\ncating a new table with more slots than the old tab le had. Because the table must \\nalways reside in contiguous memory, the system must allocate a new array for the \\nlarger table and then copy items from the old table into the new table. \\nA common heuristic allocates a new table with twice  as many slots as the old \\none. If the only table operations are insertions, t hen the load factor of the table is \\nalways at least 1=2, and thus the amount of wasted space never exceeds  half the \\ntotal space in the table. \\nThe TABLE -I NSERT procedure on the following page assumes that T is an object \\nrepresenting the table. The attribute T: table contains a pointer to the block of \\nstorage representing the table, T: num contains the number of items in the table, \\nand T: size gives the total number of slots in the table. Initially, the table is empty: \\nT: num D T: size D 0. \\nThere are two types of insertion here: the T ABLE -I NSERT procedure itself and \\nthe elementary insertion into a table in lines 6 and 10. We can analyze the running \\ntime of TABLE -I NSERT in terms of the number of elementary insertions by assign- \\ning a cost of 1 to each elementary insertion. In most computing environments, the \\noverhead for allocating an initial table in line 2 is constant and the overhead for \\nallocating and freeing storage in lines 5 and 7 is dominated by the cost of transfer- \\n1 In some situations, such as an open-address hash table, it’s better to consider a table to be full if its \\nload factor equals some constant strictly less than 1.

An expansion occurs when lines 539 execute. \\nNow, we’ll use all three amortized analysis techniques to analyze a sequence of \\nn TABLE -I NSERT operations on an initially empty table. First, we n eed to deter- \\nmine the actual cost c i of the i th operation.

For \\nn operations, the worst-case cost of an operation is O.n/, which leads to an upper \\nbound of O.n 2 / on the total running time for n operations. \\nThis bound is not tight, because the table rarely e xpands in the course of n \\nTABLE -I NSERT operations.

For example, suppose that the size of \\nthe table is m immediately after an expansion, as shown in Figure 16.3 for m D 8. \\nThen the table holds m=2 items, and it contains no credit. Each call of T ABLE - \\nI NSERT charges $3. The elementary insertion that occurs immediately costs $ 1. \\nAnother $1 resides on the item inserted as credit. The third $ 1 resides as credit \\non one of the m=2 items already in the table. The table will not ûll again until \\nanother m=2 \\ue003 1 items have been inserted, and thus, by the time the table contains \\nm items and is full, each item has $1 on it to pay for it to be reinserted it during the \\nexpansion. \\nNow, let’s see how to use the potential method. We’ll use it again in Sec- \\ntion 16.4.2 to design a TABLE -DELETE operation that has an O.1/ amortized cost '),\n",

Just as the accounting method had no stored credit immediately after an \\nexpansion4that is, when T: num D T: size=24let’s deûne the potential to be 0 \\nwhen T: num D T: size=2. As elementary insertions occur, the potential nee ds to \\nincrease enough to pay for all the reinsertions tha t will happen when the table \\nnext expands. The table ûlls after another T: size=2 calls of TABLE -I NSERT , when \\nT: num D T: size. The next call of T ABLE -I NSERT after these T: size=2 calls trig- \\ngers an expansion with a cost of T: size to reinsert all the items. Therefore, over \\nthe course of T: size=2 calls of TABLE -I NSERT , the potential must increase from 0 \\nto T: size. To achieve this increase, let’s design the potential so that each call of \\nTABLE -I NSERT increases it by \\nT: size \\nT: size=2 D 2; \\nuntil the table expands. You can see that the potential function \\nˆ.T/ D 2.T: num \\ue003 T: size=2/ (16.4) \\nequals 0 immediately after the table expands, when T: num D T: size=2, and it \\nincreases by 2 upon each insertion until the table ûlls. Once the table ûlls, that is, \\nwhen T: num D T: size, the potential ˆ.T/ equals T: size. The initial value of the \\npotential is 0, and since the table is always at least half full,  T: num \\ue004 T: size=2, \\nwhich implies that ˆ.T/ is always nonnegative. Thus, the sum of the amortiz ed \\ncosts of n TABLE -I NSERT operations gives an upper bound on the sum of the actual \\ncosts. \\nTo analyze the amortized costs of table operations,  it is convenient to think in \\nterms of the change in potential due to each operat ion. Letting ˆ i denote the \\npotential after the i th operation, we can rewrite equation (16.2) as \\ny c i D c i C ˆ i \\ue003 ˆ i \\ue0021 \\nD c i C �ˆ i ; \\nwhere �ˆ i is the change in potential due to the i th operation. First, consider the \\ncase when the i th insertion does not cause the table to expand. In  this case, �ˆ i \\nis 2. Since the actual cost c i is 1, the amortized cost is \\ny c i D c i C �ˆ i \\nD 1 C 2 \\nD 3: \\nNow, consider the change in potential when the tabl e does expand during the i th \\ninsertion because it was full immediately before th e insertion. Let num i denote \\nthe number of items stored in the table after the i th operation and size i denote the \\ntotal size of the table after the i th operation, so that size i \\ue0021 D num i \\ue0021 D i \\ue003 1 '),\n",

Immediately \\nbefore an expansion, the potential has built up to the number of items in the table, and therefore it can \\npay for moving all the items to the new table.

In order to limit the amount of wasted space, however, \\nyou might want to \\ncontract the table when the load factor becomes too small. Ta- '),\n",

You can then free the storage for the old table by return- \\ning it to the memory-management system. In order to not waste space, yet keep \\nthe amortized costs low, the insertion and deletion procedures should preserve two \\nproperties: \\n\\ue001 the load factor of the dynamic table is bounded below by a positive constant, as \\nwell as above by 1, and \\n\\ue001 the amortized cost of a table operation is bounded above by a constant. \\nThe actual cost of each operation equals the number  of elementary insertions or \\ndeletions. \\nYou might think that if you double the table size u pon inserting an item into a \\nfull table, then you should halve the size when del eting an item that would cause \\nthe table to become less than half full. This strategy does indeed guarantee that the \\nload factor of the table never drops below 1=2. Unfortunately, it can also cause the \\namortized cost of an operation to be quite large. C onsider the following scenario. \\nPerform n operations on a table T of size n=2, where n is an exact power of 2. \\nThe ûrst n=2 operations are insertions, which by our previous analysis cost a total \\nof ‚.n/. At the end of this sequence of insertions, T: num D T: size D n=2. For \\nthe second n=2 operations, perform the following sequence: \\ninsert, delete, delete, insert, insert, delete, delete, insert, insert, . . . . \\nThe ûrst insertion causes the table to expand to size n. The two deletions that follow \\ncause the table to contract back to size n=2. Two further insertions cause another \\nexpansion, and so forth. The cost of each expansion  and contraction is ‚.n/, and \\nthere are ‚.n/ of them. Thus, the total cost of the n operations is ‚.n 2 /, making \\nthe amortized cost of an operation ‚.n/. \\nThe problem with this strategy is that after the ta ble expands, not enough dele- \\ntions occur to pay for a contraction. Likewise, after the table contracts, not enough \\ninsertions take place to pay for an expansion. \\nHow can we solve this problem? Allow the load factor of the table to drop \\nbelow 1=2. Speciûcally, continue to double the table size upon inserting an item \\ninto a full table, but halve the table size when de leting an item causes the table to \\nbecome less than 1=4 full, rather than 1=2 full as before. The load factor of the \\ntable is therefore bounded below by the constant 1=4, and the load factor is 1=2 \\nimmediately after a contraction. \\nAn expansion or contraction should exhaust all the built-up potential, so that \\nimmediately after expansion or contraction, when the load factor is 1=2, the table’s \\npotential is 0. Figure 16.5 shows the idea. As the load factor deviates from 1=2, the '),\n",

When the \\nload factor ˛ is 1=2, the potential is 0. In order to accumulate sufûcient potential to pay for reinserting \\nall T: size items when the table ûlls, the potential needs to increase by 2 upon each insertion when \\n˛ \\ue004 1=2. Correspondingly, the potential decreases by 2 upon each deletion that leaves ˛ \\ue004 1=2. \\nIn order to accrue enough potential to cover the cost of reinserting all T: size=4 items when the table \\ncontracts, the potential needs to increase by 1 upon each deletion when ˛<1=2 , and correspondingly \\nthe potential decreases by 1 upon each insertion that leaves ˛ < 1=2 . The red area represents load \\nfactors less than 1=4, which are not allowed. \\npotential increases so that by the time an expansion or contraction occurs, the table \\nhas garnered sufûcient potential to pay for copying all the items into the newly \\nallocated table. Thus, the potential function should grow to T: num by the time that \\nthe load factor has either increased to 1 or decreased to 1=4. Immediately after \\neither expanding or contracting the table, the load factor goes back to 1=2 and the \\ntable’s potential reduces back to 0. \\nWe omit the code for TABLE -DELETE , since it is analogous to TABLE -I NSERT . \\nWe assume that if a contraction occurs during TABLE -DELETE , it occurs after the \\nitem is deleted from the table. The analysis assume s that whenever the number of \\nitems in the table drops to 0, the table occupies no storage. That is, if T: num D 0, \\nthen T: size D 0. \\nHow do we design a potential function that gives co nstant amortized time for \\nboth insertion and deletion? When the load factor is at least 1=2, the same potential \\nfunction, ˆ.T/ D 2.T: num \\ue003 T: size=2/, that we used for insertion still works. \\nWhen the table is at least half full, each insertion increases the potential by 2 if the \\ntable does not expand, and each deletion reduces th e potential by 2 if it does not \\ncause the load factor to drop below 1=2. \\nWhat about when the load factor is less than 1=2, that is, when 1=4 හ ˛.T/<  \\n1=2? As before, when ˛.T/ D 1=2, so that T: num D T: size=2, the potential ˆ.T/ \\nshould be 0. To get the load factor from 1=2 down to 1=4, T: size=4 deletions need '),\n",

To pay for all the reinsertions, the \\npotential must increase from 0 to T: size=4 over these T: size=4 deletions. There- \\nfore, for each call of TABLE -DELETE until the table contracts, the potential should \\nincrease by \\nT: size=4 \\nT: size=4 D 1: \\nLikewise, when ˛<1=2 , each call of TABLE -I NSERT should decrease the poten- \\ntial by 1. When 1=4 හ ˛.T/<1=2 , the potential function \\nˆ.T/ D T: size=2 \\ue003 T: num \\nproduces this desired behavior. \\nPutting the two cases together, we get the potential function \\nˆ.T/ D \\n( \\n2.T: num \\ue003 T: size=2/ if ˛.T/ \\ue004 1=2; \\nT: size=2 \\ue003 T: num if ˛.T/<1=2:  (16.5) \\nThe potential of an empty table is 0 and the potential is never negative. Thus, \\nthe total amortized cost of a sequence of operations with respect to ˆ provides an \\nupper bound on the actual cost of the sequence. Figure 16.6 illustrates how the \\npotential function behaves over a sequence of insertions and deletions. \\nNow, let’s determine the amortized costs of each operation. As before, let num i \\ndenote the number of items stored in the table afte r the i th operation, size i denote \\nthe total size of the table after the i th operation, ˛ i D num i =size i denote the load \\nfactor after the i th operation, ˆ i denote the potential after the i th operation, and \\n�ˆ i denote the change in potential due to the i th operation. Initially, num 0 D 0, \\nsize 0 D 0, and ˆ 0 D 0. \\nThe cases in which the table does not expand or contract and the load factor does \\nnot cross ˛ D 1=2 are straightforward.

For each B-tree operation, the number of disk accesses increases with the \\nheight of the B-tree, but B-tree operations keep the height low. \\nChapter 19 examines data structures for disjoint sets.

Other advanced data structures include the following: \\n\\ue001 Fibonacci heaps [156] implement mergeable heaps (see Problem 10-2 on \\npage 268) with the operations I NSERT , MINIMUM , and U NION taking only \\nO.1/ actual and amortized time, and the operations E XTRACT -MIN and \\nDELETE taking O.lg n/ amortized time. The most signiûcant advantage of \\nthese data structures, however, is that DECREASE -KEY takes only O.1/ amor- \\ntized time. Strict Fibonacci heaps [73], developed later, made all of these time \\nbounds actual. Because the D ECREASE -KEY operation takes constant amor- \\ntized time, (strict) Fibonacci heaps constitute key  components of some of the \\nasymptotically fastest algorithms to date for graph problems. \\n\\ue001 Dynamic trees [415, 429] maintain a forest of disjoint rooted trees. Each edge \\nin each tree has a real-valued cost. Dynamic trees support queries to ûnd par- \\nents, roots, edge costs, and the minimum edge cost on a simple path from a node \\nup to a root. Trees may be manipulated by cutting edges, updating all edge costs \\non a simple path from a node up to a root, linking a root into another tree, and \\nmaking a node the root of the tree it appears in. One implementation of dynamic \\ntrees gives an O.lg n/ amortized time bound for each operation, while a mo re \\ncomplicated implementation yields O.lg n/ worst-case time bounds. Dynamic \\ntrees are used in some of the asymptotically fastest network-üow algorithms. \\n\\ue001 Splay trees [418, 429] are a form of binary search tree on which the standard \\nsearch-tree operations run in O.lg n/ amortized time. One application of splay \\ntrees simpliûes dynamic trees. \\n\\ue001 Persistent data structures allow queries, and sometimes updates as well, on past \\nversions of a data structure. For example, linked d ata structures can be made \\npersistent with only a small time and space cost [126]. Problem 13-1 gives a \\nsimple example of a persistent dynamic set. \\n\\ue001 Several data structures allow a faster implementati on of dictionary operations \\n(I NSERT , DELETE , and S EARCH ) for a restricted universe of keys. By tak- \\ning advantage of these restrictions, they are able to achieve better worst-case \\nasymptotic running times than comparison-based data structures.

Rarely will you need to create an entirely new type of data structure, \\nthough. More often, you can augment a textbook data  structure by storing addi- \\ntional information in it. You can then program new operations for the data structure \\nto support your application. Augmenting a data structure is not always straightfor- \\nward, however, since the added information must be updated and maintained by \\nthe ordinary operations on the data structure. \\nThis chapter discusses two data structures based on red-black trees that are aug- \\nmented with additional information. Section 17.1 describes a data structure that \\nsupports general order-statistic operations on a dynamic set: quickly ûnding the \\ni th smallest number or the rank of a given element. Section 17.2 abstracts the pro- \\ncess of augmenting a data structure and provides a theorem that you can use when \\naugmenting red-black trees. Section 17.3 uses this theorem to help design a data \\nstructure for maintaining a dynamic set of interval s, such as time intervals.

Each node x contains the usual red-black tree attributes x: key, \\nx: color, x: p, x: left, and x: right , along with a new attribute, x: size. This attribute \\ncontains the number of internal nodes in the subtree rooted at x (including x itself, \\nbut not including any sentinels), that is, the size  of the sub tree. If we deûne the \\nsentinel’s size to be 04that is, we set T: nil: size to be 04then we have the identity \\nx: size D x: left: size C x: right: size C 1: \\nKeys need not be distinct in an order-statistic tree. For example, the tree in Fig- \\nure 17.1 has two keys with value 14 and two keys with value 21. When equal keys \\nare present, the above notion of rank is not well deûned. We remove this ambiguity \\nfor an order-statistic tree by deûning the rank of an element as the position at which \\nit would be printed in an inorder walk of the tree.

Thus, x: left: size C 1 \\nis the rank of x within the subtree rooted at x . If i D r , then node x is the i th \\nsmallest element, and so line 3 returns x . If i < r , then the i th smallest element \\nresides in x ’s left subtree, and therefore, line 5 recurses on x: left. If i > r , then \\nthe i th smallest element resides in x ’s right subtree. Since the subtree rooted at x \\ncontains r elements that come before x ’s right subtree in an inorder tree walk, the \\ni th smallest element in the subtree rooted at x is the .i \\ue003 r/th smallest element in \\nthe subtree rooted at x: right. Line 6 determines this element recursively. \\nAs an example of how OS-SELECT operates, consider a search for the 17th \\nsmallest element in the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1. The search starts with x \\nas the root, whose key is 26, and with i D 17. Since the size of 26’s left subtree \\nis 12, its rank is 13. Thus, the node with rank 17 is the 17 \\ue003 13 D 4th smallest \\nelement in 26’s right subtree. In the recursive call, x is the node with key 41, and \\ni D 4. Since the size of 41’s left subtree is 5, its rank within its subtree is 6. \\nTherefore, the node with rank 4 is the 4th smallest element in 41’s left subtree. In \\nthe recursive call, x is the node with key 30, and its rank within its subtree is 2. \\nThe procedure recurses once again to ûnd the 4 \\ue003 2 D 2nd smallest element in the \\nsubtree rooted at the node with key 38. Its left subtree has size 1, which means it \\nis the second smallest element. Thus, the procedure  returns a pointer to the node \\nwith key 38. \\nBecause each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic tree, the \\ntotal time for OS-SELECT is at worst proportional to the height of the tree.  Since \\nthe tree is a red-black tree, its height is O.lg n/, where n is the number of nodes. \\nThus, the running time of OS-SELECT is O.lg n/ for a dynamic set of n elements. \\nDetermining the rank of an element \\nGiven a pointer to a node x in an order-statistic tree T , the procedure OS-RANK \\non the facing page returns the position of x in the linear order determined by an \\ninorder tree walk of T .

You can think of node x ’s rank \\nas the number of nodes preceding x in an inorder tree walk, plus 1 for x itself. \\nOS-RANK maintains the following loop invariant: \\nAt the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 336, r is the rank \\nof x: key in the subtree rooted at node y . \\nWe use this loop invariant to show that OS-RANK works correctly as follows: \\nInitialization: Prior to the ûrst iteration, line 1 sets r to be the rank of x: key \\nwithin the subtree rooted at x . Setting y D x in line 2 makes the invariant true \\nthe ûrst time the test in line 3 executes. \\nMaintenance: At the end of each iteration of the while loop, line 6 sets y D y: p. \\nThus, we must show that if r is the rank of x: key in the subtree rooted at y at the \\nstart of the loop body, then r is the rank of x: key in the subtree rooted at y: p \\nat the end of the loop body. In each iteration of t he while loop, consider the \\nsubtree rooted at y: p. The value of r already includes the number of nodes \\nin the subtree rooted at node y that precede x in an inorder walk, and so the \\nprocedure must add the nodes in the subtree rooted at y ’s sibling that precede x \\nin an inorder walk, plus 1 for y: p if it, too, precedes x . If y is a left child, then \\nneither y: p nor any node in y: p’s right subtree precedes x , and so OS-RANK \\nleaves r alone. Otherwise, y is a right child and all the nodes in y: p’s left \\nsubtree precede x , as does y: p itself. In this case, line 5 adds y: p: left: size C 1 \\nto the current value of r . \\nTermination: Because each iteration of the loop moves y toward the root and the \\nloop terminates when y D T: root , the loop eventually terminates. Moreover, \\nthe subtree rooted at y is the entire tree. Thus, the value of r is the rank of \\nx: key in the entire tree. \\nAs an example, when OS-RANK runs on the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1 \\nto ûnd the rank of the node with key 38, the following sequence of values of y: key \\nand r occurs at the top of the while loop: '),\n",

But if the basic modifying operations on red- \\nblack trees cannot efûciently maintain the size attribute, our work will have been \\nfor naught. Let’s see how to maintain subtree sizes for both insertion and deletion \\nwithout affecting the asymptotic running time of either operation. \\nRecall from Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists of two \\nphases. The ûrst phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node \\nas a child of an existing node. The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors \\nand performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties. \\nTo maintain the subtree sizes in the ûrst phase, simply increment x: size for each \\nnode x on the simple path traversed from the root down tow ard the leaves. The \\nnew node added gets a size of 1. Since there are O.lg n/ nodes on the traversed \\npath, the additional cost of maintaining the size attributes is O.lg n/. \\nIn the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree \\nare caused by rotations, of which there are at most  two. Moreover, a rotation is \\na local operation: only two nodes have their size attributes invalidated. The link \\naround which the rotation is performed is incident on these two nodes. Referring \\nto the code for LEFT-ROTATE .T;x/ on page 336, add the following lines: \\n13 y: size D x: size \\n14 x: size D x: left: size C x: right : size C 1 \\nFigure 17.2 illustrates how the attributes are updated. The change to R IGHT- \\nROTATE is symmetric. \\nSince inserting into a red-black tree requires at most two rotations, updating the \\nsize attributes in the second phase costs only O.1/ additional time. Thus, the total \\ntime for insertion into an n-node order-statistic tree is O.lg n/, which is asymptot- \\nically the same as for an ordinary red-black tree. '),\n",

The updates are local, requiring only the size \\ninformation stored in x, y, and the roots of the subtrees shown as triangles. \\nDeletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the ûrst operates \\non the underlying search tree, and the second cause s at most three rotations and \\notherwise performs no structural changes. (See Section 13.4.) The ûrst phase \\nremoves one node ´ from the tree and could move at most two other nodes within \\nthe tree (nodes y and x in Figure 12.4 on page 323). To update the subtree sizes, \\nsimply traverse a simple path from the lowest node that moves (starting from its \\noriginal position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the size attribute \\nof each node on the path. Since this path has lengt h O.lg n/ in an n-node red- \\nblack tree, the additional time spent maintaining size attributes in the ûrst phase \\nis O.lg n/.

Never- \\ntheless, this four-step method provides a good focus for your efforts in augmenting \\na data structure, and it is also a good framework f or documenting an augmented \\ndata structure. \\nWe followed these four steps in Section 17.1 to design order-statistic trees. For \\nstep 1, we chose red-black trees as the underlying data structure. Red-black trees \\nseemed like a good starting point because they efûciently support other dynamic- \\nset operations on a total order, such as M INIMUM , MAXIMUM , SUCCESSOR , and \\nPREDECESSOR . \\nIn Step 2, we added the size attribute, so that each node x stores the size of the \\nsubtree rooted at x . Generally, the additional information makes operations more \\nefûcient. For example, it is possible to implement OS-SELECT and OS-RANK \\nusing just the keys stored in the tree, but then th ey would not run in O.lg n/ time. \\nSometimes, the additional information is pointer in formation rather than data, as \\nin Exercise 17.2-1. \\nFor step 3, we ensured that insertion and deletion can maintain the size attributes \\nwhile still running in O.lg n/ time. Ideally, you would like to update only a few \\nelements of the data structure in order to maintain  the additional information. For \\nexample, if each node simply stores its rank in the tree, the OS-SELECT and \\nOS-RANK procedures run quickly, but inserting a new minimum  element might \\ncause a change to this information in every node of the tree. Because we chose to \\nstore subtree sizes instead, inserting a new elemen t causes information to change \\nin only O.lg n/ nodes. \\nIn Step 4, we developed the operations OS-SELECT and OS-RANK. After all, \\nthe need for new operations is why anyone bothers t o augment a data structure in \\nthe ûrst place. Occasionally, rather than developing new operations, you can use \\nthe additional information to expedite existing ones, as in Exercise 17.2-1. \\nAugmenting red-black trees \\nWhen red-black trees underlie an augmented data structure, we can prove that in- \\nsertion and deletion can always efûciently maintain certain kinds of additional in- \\nformation, thereby simplifying step 3. The proof of the following theorem is sim- \\nilar to the argument from Section 17.1 that we can maintain the size attribute for \\norder-statistic trees. \\nTheorem 17.1 (Augmenting a red-black tree) \\nLet f be an attribute that augments a red-black tree T of n nodes, and suppose that \\nthe value of f for each node x depends only the information in nodes x , x: left, and \\nx: right (possibly including x: left: f and x: right : f ), and that the value of x: f can '),\n",

Then, the insertion and deletion \\noperations can maintain the values of f in all nodes of T without asymptotically \\naffecting the O.lg n/ running times of these operations. \\nProof The main idea of the proof is that a change to an f attribute in a node x \\npropagates only to ancestors of x in the tree. That is, changing x: f may require \\nx: p: f to be updated, but nothing else; updating x: p: f may require x: p: p: f to be \\nupdated, but nothing else; and so on up the tree. A fter updating T: root : f , no other \\nnode depends on the new value, and so the process terminates. Since the height of \\na red-black tree is O.lg n/, changing an f attribute in a node costs O.lg n/ time in \\nupdating all nodes that depend on the change. \\nAs we saw in Section 13.3, insertion of a node x into red-black tree T consists \\nof two phases. If the tree T is empty, then the ûrst phase simply makes x be the \\nroot of T . If T is not empty, then the ûrst phase inserts x as a child of an existing \\nnode. Because we assume that the value of x: f depends only on information in \\nthe other attributes of x itself and the information in x ’s children, and because x ’s \\nchildren are both the sentinel T: nil, it takes only O.1/ time to compute the value \\nof x: f . Having computed x: f , the change propagates up the tree. Thus, the tota l \\ntime for the ûrst phase of insertion is O.lg n/. During the second phase, the only \\nstructural changes to the tree come from rotations. Since only two nodes change in \\na rotation, but a change to an attribute might need  to propagate up to the root, the \\ntotal time for updating the f attributes is O.lg n/ per rotation. Since the number \\nof rotations during insertion is at most two, the total time for insertion is O.lg n/. \\nLike insertion, deletion has two phases, as Section 13.4 discusses. In the ûrst \\nphase, changes to the tree occur when a node is del eted, and at most two other \\nnodes could move within the tree. Propagating the u pdates to f caused by these \\nchanges costs at most O.lg n/, since the changes modify the tree locally along a  \\nsimple path from the lowest changed node to the root. Fixing up the red-black tree \\nduring the second phase requires at most three rotations, and each rotation requires \\nat most O.lg n/ time to propagate the updates to f . Thus, like insertion, the total \\ntime for deletion is O.lg n/. \\nIn many cases, such as maintaining the size attributes in order-statistic trees, the \\ncost of updating after a rotation is O.1/, rather than the O.lg n/ derived in the proof \\nof Theorem 17.1. Exercise 17.2-3 gives an example. \\nOn the other hand, when an update after a rotation requires a traversal all the way \\nup to the root, it is important that insertion into  and deletion from a red-black tree \\nrequire a constant number of rotations. The chapter notes for Chapter 13 list other \\nschemes for balancing search trees that do not boun d the number of rotations per \\ninsertion or deletion by a constant.

In this section, we’ll assume that intervals are closed. Ex- \\ntending the results to open and half-open intervals is conceptually straightforward. \\n(See page 1157 for deûnitions of closed, open, and half-open intervals.) \\nIntervals are convenient for representing events th at each occupy a continuous \\nperiod of time. For example, you could query a data base of tim e intervals to ûnd \\nout which events occurred during a given interval. The data structure in this section \\nprovides an efûcient means for maintaining such an interval database. \\nA simple way to represent an interval Œt 1 ;t 2 � is as an object i with attributes \\ni: low D t 1 (the low endpoint) and i: high D t 2 (the high endpoint).

Let’s look for an interval that overlaps the \\ninterval i D Œ22; 25�. Begin with x as the root, which contains Œ16; 21� and does \\nnot overlap i . Since x: left: max D 23 is greater than i: low D 22, the loop continues \\nwith x as the left child of the root4the node containing Œ8; 9�, which also does not \\noverlap i . This time, x: left: max D 10 is less than i: low D 22, and so the loop \\ncontinues with the right child of x as the new x . Because the interval Œ15; 23� \\nstored in this node overlaps i , the procedure returns this node. \\nNow let’s try an unsuccessful search, for an interval that overlaps i D Œ11; 14� \\nin the interval tree of Figure 17.4. Again, begin with x as the root. Since the \\nroot’s interval Œ16; 21� does not overlap i , and since x: left: max D 23 is greater \\nthan i: low D 11, go left to the node containing Œ8; 9�. Interval Œ8; 9� does not over- \\nlap i , and x: left: max D 10 is less than i: low D 11, and so the search goes right. \\n(No interval in the left subtree overlaps i .) Interval Œ15; 23� does not overlap i , \\nand its left child is T: nil, so again the search goes right, the loop terminat es, and \\nI NTERVAL -SEARCH returns the sentinel T: nil. '),\n",

The basic i dea is that at any node x , \\nif x: int does not overlap i , the search always proceeds in a safe direction: t he \\nsearch will deûnitely ûnd an overlapping interval if the tree contains one. The \\nfollowing theorem states this property more precisely. \\nTheorem 17.2 \\nAny execution of I NTERVAL -SEARCH .T;i/ either returns a node whose interval \\noverlaps i , or it returns T: nil and the tree T contains no node whose interval over- \\nlaps i . \\nProof The while loop of lines 235 terminates when either x D T: nil or i overlaps \\nx: int. In the latter case, it is certainly correct to re turn x . Therefore, we focus on \\nthe former case, in which the while loop terminates because x D T: nil, which is \\nthe node that I NTERVAL -SEARCH returns. \\nWe’ll prove that if the procedure returns T: nil, then it did not miss any intervals \\nin T that overlap i . The idea is to show that whether the search goes left in line 4 or \\nright in line 5, it always heads toward a node containing an interval overlapping i , \\nif any such interval exists. In particular, we’ll prove that \\n1. If the search goes left in line 4, then the left subtree of node x contains an inter- \\nval that overlaps i or the right subtree of x contains no interval that overlaps i . \\nTherefore, even if x ’s left subtree contains no interval that overlaps i but the \\nsearch goes left, it does not make a mistake, because x ’s right subtree does not \\ncontain an interval overlapping i , either. \\n2. If the search goes right in line 5, then the left subtree of x contains no interval \\nthat overlaps i . Thus, if the search goes right, it does not make a mistake. \\nFor both cases, we rely on the interval trichotomy. Let’s start with the case \\nwhere the search goes right, whose proof is simpler . By the te sts in line 3, we \\nknow that x: left D T: nil or x: left: max < i: low. If x: left D T: nil, then x ’s left \\nsubtree contains no interval that overlaps i , since it contains no intervals at all. Now \\nsuppose that x: left ¤ T: nil, so that we must have x: left: max < i: low. Consider \\nany interval i 0 in x ’s left subtree. Because x: left : max is the maximum endpoint in \\nx ’s left subtree, we have i 0 : high හ x: left: max. Thus, as Figure 17.5(a) shows, \\ni 0 : high හ x: left: max \\n< i: low : \\nBy the interval trichotomy, therefore, intervals i and i 0 do not overlap, and so x ’s \\nleft subtree contains no interval that overlaps i . \\nNow we examine the case in which the search goes le ft.

B-trees are similar to red-black trees \\n(Chapter 13), but they are better at minimizing the number of operations that access \\ndisks. (We often say just <disk= instead of <disk d rive.=) Many database systems \\nuse B-trees, or variants of B-trees, to store information. \\nB-trees differ from red-black trees in that B-tree nodes may have many children, \\nfrom a few to thousands. That is, the <branching fa ctor= of a B -tree can be quite \\nlarge, although it usually depends on characteristics of the disk drive used. B-trees \\nare similar to red-black trees in that every n-node B-tree has height O.lg n/, so that \\nB-trees can implement many dynamic-set operations in O.lg n/ time. But a B-tree \\nhas a larger branching factor than a red-black tree, so the base of the logarithm that \\nexpresses its height is larger, and hence its height can be considerably lower. \\nB-trees generalize binary search trees in a natural manner. Figure 18.1 shows a \\nsimple B-tree. If an internal B-tree node x contains x:n keys, then x has x:n C 1 \\nchildren. The keys in node x serve as dividing points separating the range of keys \\nhandled by x into x:n C 1 subranges, each handled by one child of x .

This technology is typically more than an order of magnitude more \\nexpensive per bit stored than magnetic storage tech nology, such as tapes or disk \\ndrives. Most computer systems also have secondary storage based on solid-state \\ndrives (SSDs) or magnetic disk drives. The amount of such secondary storage often \\nexceeds the amount of primary memory by one to two orders of magnitude. SSDs \\nhave faster access times than magnetic disk drives, which are mechanical devices. \\nIn recent years, SSD capacities have increased whil e their prices have decreased. \\nMagnetic disk drives typically have much higher cap acities than SSDs, and they \\nremain a more cost-effective means for storing massive amounts of information. \\nDisk drives that store several terabytes 1 can be found for under $100. \\nFigure 18.2 shows a typical disk drive. The drive consists of one or more plat- \\nters, which rotate at a constant speed around a common spindle. A magnetizable \\nmaterial covers the surface of each platter. The dr ive reads and writes each plat- \\nter by a head at the end of an arm. The arms can move their heads toward or \\naway from the spindle. The surface that passes underneath a given head when it is \\nstationary is called a track. \\nAlthough disk drives are cheaper and have higher ca pacity than main memory, \\nthey are much, much slower because they have moving  mechanical parts. The \\nmechanical motion has two components: platter rotation and arm movement. As of \\nthis writing, commodity disk drives rotate at speeds of 5400315,000 revolutions per \\nminute (RPM). Typical speeds are 15,000 RPM in server-grade drives, 7200 RPM \\n1 When specifying disk capacities, one terabyte is one trillion bytes, rather than 2 40 bytes. '),\n",

Although 7200 RPM \\nmay seem fast, one rotation takes 8:33 milliseconds, which is over 5 orders of \\nmagnitude longer than the 50 nanosecond access times (more or less) commonly \\nfound for main memory. In other words, if a compute r waits a full rotation for a \\nparticular item to come under the read/write head, it could access main memory \\nmore than 100,000 times during that span. The average wait is only half a rotation, \\nbut still, the difference in access times for main memory compared with disk drives \\nis enormous. Moving the arms also takes some time. As of this writing, average \\naccess times for commodity disk drives are around 4 milliseconds. \\nIn order to amortize the time spent waiting for mec hanical movements, also \\nknown as \\nlatency, disk drives access not just one item but several at a time.

Fo r this reason, in this chapter \\nwe’ll look separately at the two principal components of the running time: \\n\\ue001 the number of disk accesses, and \\n\\ue001 the CPU (computing) time. \\nWe measure the number of disk accesses in terms of the number of blocks of infor- \\nmation that need to be read from or written to the disk drive. Although disk-access \\ntime is not constant4it depends on the distance between the current track and the \\ndesired track and also on the initial rotational position of the platters4the number \\nof blocks read or written provides a good ûrst-order approximation of the total time \\nspent accessing the disk drive. \\nIn a typical B-tree application, the amount of data handled is so large that all \\nthe data do not ût into main memory at once. The B-tree algorithms copy selected \\nblocks from disk into main memory as needed and write back onto disk the blocks \\nthat have changed. B-tree algorithms keep only a constant number of blocks in \\nmain memory at any time, and thus the size of main memory does not limit the size \\nof B-trees that can be handled. \\nB-tree procedures need to be able to read information from disk into main mem- \\nory and write information from main memory to disk. Consider some object x . If x \\nis currently in the computer’s main memory, then the code can refer to the attributes \\nof x as usual: x: key, for example. If x resides on disk, however, then the procedure \\nmust perform the operation D ISK-READ .x/ to read the block containing object x \\ninto main memory before it can refer to x ’s attributes. (Assume that if x is already \\nin main memory, then D ISK-READ .x/ requires no disk accesses: it is a <no-op.=) \\nSimilarly, procedures call D ISK-WRITE .x/ to save any changes that have been \\nmade to the attributes of object x by writing to disk the block containing x .

As in in- \\nsertion, you must guard against deletion producing a tree whose structure violates \\nthe B-tree properties. Just as a node should not get too big due to insertion, a node \\nmust not get too small during deletion (except that the root is allowed to have fewer \\nthan the minimum number t \\ue003 1 of keys). And just as a simple insertion algorithm \\nmight have to back up if a node on the path to wher e the key is to be inserted is \\nfull, a simple approach to deletion might have to back up if a node (other than the \\nroot) along the path to where the key is to be dele ted has the minimum number of \\nkeys. \\nThe procedure B-TREE -DELETE deletes the key k from the subtree rooted at x . \\nUnlike the procedures TREE -DELETE on page 325 and RB-DELETE on page 348, \\nwhich are given the node to delete4presumably as the result of a prior search4 \\nB-TREE -DELETE combines the search for key k with the deletion process. Why \\ndo we combine search and deletion in B-TREE -DELETE ? Just as B-TREE -I NSERT \\nprevents any node from becoming overfull (having mo re than 2t \\ue003 1 keys) while \\nmaking a single pass down the tree, B-TREE -DELETE prevents any node from \\nbecoming underfull (having fewer than t \\ue003 1 keys) while also making a single pass \\ndown the tree, searching for and ultimately deleting the key. \\nTo prevent any node from becoming underfull, the design of B- TREE -DELETE \\nguarantees that whenever it calls itself recursively on a node x , the number of keys \\nin x is at least the minimum degree t at the time of the call. (Although the root \\nmay have fewer than t keys and a recursive call may be made from the root, no \\nrecursive call is made on the root.) This condition requires one more key tha n the \\nminimum required by the usual B-tree conditions, and so a key might have to be \\nmoved from x into one of its child nodes (still leaving x with at least the minimum \\nt \\ue003 1 keys) before a recursive call is made on that child, thus allowing deletion to \\noccur in one downward pass without having to traverse back up the tree. \\nWe describe how the procedure B-TREE -DELETE .T;k/ deletes a key k from \\na B-tree T instead of presenting detailed pseudocode. We exami ne three cases, \\nillustrated in Figure 18.8. The cases are for when the search arrives at a leaf, at an \\ninternal node containing key k, and at an internal node not containing key k. As \\nmentioned above, in all three cases node x has at least t keys (with the possible \\nexception of when x is the root). Cases 2 and 34when x is an internal node4 \\nguarantee this property as the recursion descends through the B-tree. '),\n",

The stack can grow to be \\nmuch larger than can ût in memory, and thus most of it must be stored on disk. \\nA simple, but inefûcient, stack implementation keeps the entire stack on disk. \\nMaintain in memory a stack pointer, which is the di sk address of the top element \\non the stack. Indexing block numbers and word offsets within blocks from 0, if the \\npointer has value p, the top element is the .p mod m/th word on block bp=mc of \\nthe disk, where m is the number of words per block. \\nTo implement the PUSH operation, increment the stack pointer, read the appro- \\npriate block into memory from disk, copy the element to be pushed to the appropri- \\nate word on the block, and write the block back to disk. A P OP operation is similar. \\nRead in the appropriate block from disk, save the t op of the stack, decrement the \\nstack pointer, and return the saved value. You need not write back the block, since \\nit was not modiûed, and the word in the block that contained the popped value is \\nignored. \\nAs in the analyses of B-tree operations, two costs matter: the total number of \\ndisk accesses and the total CPU time. A disk access  also incurs a cost in CPU \\ntime. In particular, any disk access to a block of m words incurs charges of one \\ndisk access and ‚.m/ CPU time. \\na.

This chapter explores methods for maintaining a data \\nstructure that supports these operations. \\nSection 19.1 describes the operations supported by a disjoint-set data structure \\nand presents a simple application. Section 19.2 looks at a simple linked-list imple- \\nmentation for disjoint sets. Section 19.3 presents a more efûcient representation \\nusing rooted trees. The running time using the tree  representation is theoretically \\nsuperlinear, but for all practical purposes it is linear. Section 19.4 deûnes and dis- \\ncusses a very quickly growing function and its very slowly growing inverse, which \\nappears in the running time of operations on the tree-based implementation, and \\nthen, by a complex amortized analysis, proves an upper bound on the running time \\nthat is just barely superlinear. \\n19.1 Disjoint-set operations \\nA disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection S D fS 1 ;S 2 ;:::;S  k g of dis- \\njoint dynamic sets. To identify each set, choose a representative, which is some \\nmember of the set. In some applications, it doesn’t matter which member is used \\nas the representative; it matters only that if you ask for the representative of a dy- \\nnamic set twice without modifying the set between t he requests, you get the same \\nanswer both times. Other applications may require a prespeciûed rule for choosing \\nthe representative, such as choosing the smallest member in the set (for a set whose \\nelements can be ordered). '),\n",

The object for each set has attributes head, \\npointing to the ûrst object in the list, and tail, pointing to the last object. Each \\nobject in the list contains a set member, a pointer to the next object in the list, and \\na pointer back to the set object. Within each linke d list, the objects may appear in \\nany order. The representative is the set member in the ûrst object in the list. \\nWith this linked-list representation, both MAKE-SET and F IND -SET require \\nonly O.1/ time. To carry out M AKE-SET .x/, create a new linked list whose only \\nobject is x . For F IND -SET .x/, just follow the pointer from x back to its set ob- \\nject and then return the member in the object that head points to.

As Fig- \\nure 19.2(b) shows, the operation UNION.x;y/ appends y ’s list onto the end of x ’s \\nlist. The representative of x ’s list becomes the representative of the resulting set. \\nTo quickly ûnd where to append y ’s list, use the tail pointer for x ’s list. Because \\nall members of y ’s list join x ’s list, the UNION operation destroys the set object \\nfor y ’s list. The UNION operation is where this implementation pays the price for \\nFIND -SET taking constant time: U NION must also update the pointer to the set \\nobject for each object originally on y ’s list, which takes time linear in the length of \\ny ’s list. In Figure 19.2, for example, the operation UNION.g;e/ causes pointers to \\nbe updated in the objects for b, c , e, and h. \\nIn fact, we can construct a sequence of m operations on n objects that requires \\n‚.n 2 / time.

We start by determining, for each objec t, an upper bound on \\nthe number of times the object’s pointer back to its set object is updated. Consider \\na particular object x . Each time x ’s pointer is updated, x must have started in \\nthe smaller set. The ûrst time x ’s pointer is updated, therefore, the resulting set \\nmust have at least 2 members. Similarly, the next time x ’s pointer is updated, the \\nresulting set must have had at least 4 members. Continuing on, for any k හ n, \\nafter x ’s pointer has been updated dlg ke times, the resulting set must have at least \\nk members. Since the largest set has at most n members, each object’s pointer is \\nupdated at most dlg ne times over all the U NION operations. Thus the total time \\nspent updating object pointers over all U NION operations is O.n lg n/. We must \\nalso account for updating the tail pointers and the list lengths, which take only \\n‚.1/ time per U NION operation. The total time spent in all U NION operations is \\nthus O.n lg n/. \\nThe time for the entire sequence of m operations follows.

A \\nsequence of n \\ue003 1 UNION operations could create a tree that is just a linea r chain \\nof n nodes. By using two heuristics, however, we can ach ieve a running time that \\nis almost linear in the total number m of operations. \\nThe ûrst heuristic, union by rank, is similar to the weighted-union heuristic we \\nused with the linked-list representation. The common-sense approach is to make \\nthe root of the tree with fewer nodes point to the root of the tree with more nodes. \\nRather than explicitly keeping track of the size of the subtree rooted at each node, \\nhowever, we’ll adopt an approach that eases the analysis. For each node, maintain a \\nrank, which is an upper bound on the height of the node. Union by rank makes the \\nroot with smaller rank point to the root with larger rank during a UNION operation. \\nThe second heuristic, path compression, is also quite simple and highly effec- \\ntive. As shown in Figure 19.5, FIND -SET operations use it to make each node \\non the ûnd path point directly to the root. Path compression does not change any \\nranks. \\nPseudocode for disjoint-set forests \\nThe union-by-rank heuristic requires its implementation to keep track of ranks. \\nWith each node x , maintain the integer value x: rank, which is an upper bound on \\nthe height of x (the number of edges in the longest simple path from a descen- \\ndant leaf to x ).

If the roots have equal ranks, arbitrarily choose one of the roots as the \\nparent and increment its rank. \\nLet’s put this method into pseudocode, appearing on the next page. The parent \\nof node x is denoted by x: p. The L INK procedure, a subroutine called by UNION, \\ntakes pointers to two roots as inputs. The FIND -SET procedure with path compres- \\nsion, implemented recursively, turns out to be quite simple. \\nThe FIND -SET procedure is a two-pass method: as it recurses, it makes one pass \\nup the ûnd path to ûnd the root, and as the recursion unwinds, it makes a second \\npass back down the ûnd path to update each node to point directly to the root. \\nEach call of F IND -SET.x/ returns x: p in line 3.

The value of x: p: rank monotonically \\nincreases over time. \\nProof The proof is a straightforward induction on the num ber of operations, us- \\ning the implementations of M AKE-SET, UNION, and F IND -SET that appear on \\npage 530, and is left as Exercise 19.4-1. \\nCorollary 19.5 \\nOn the simple path from any node going up toward a root, node ranks strictly \\nincrease. \\nLemma 19.6 \\nEvery node has rank at most n \\ue003 1. \\nProof Each node’s rank starts at 0, and it increases only upon L INK operations. \\nBecause there are at most n \\ue003 1 UNION operations, there are also at most n \\ue003 1 \\nLINK operations. Because each L INK operation either leaves all ranks alone or \\nincreases some node’s rank by 1, all ranks are at most n \\ue003 1. \\nLemma 19.6 provides a weak bound on ranks. In fact, every node has rank at \\nmost blg nc (see Exercise 19.4-2). The looser bound of Lemma 19.6 sufûces for \\nour purposes, however. \\nProving the time bound \\nIn order to prove the O.m˛.n//  time bound, we’ll use the potential method of \\namortized analysis from Section 16.3. In performing the amortized analysis, it will \\nbe convenient to assume that we invoke the LINK operation rather than the UNION \\noperation. That is, since the parameters of the L INK procedure are pointers to two \\nroots, we act as though we perform the appropriate FIND -SET operations sepa- \\nrately. The following lemma shows that even if we c ount the extra F IND -SET op- \\nerations induced by UNION calls, the asymptotic running time remains unchanged. \\nLemma 19.7 \\nSuppose that we convert a sequence S 0 of m 0 MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND -SET \\noperations into a sequence S of m MAKE-SET, LINK, and F IND -SET operations \\nby turning each U NION into two F IND -SET operations followed by one L INK. \\nThen, if sequence S runs in O.m˛.n// time, sequence S 0 runs in O.m 0 ˛.n// time. \\nProof Since each U NION operation in sequence S 0 is converted into three oper- \\nations in S , we have m 0 හ m හ 3m 0 , so that m D ‚.m 0 /, Thus, an O.m˛.n// '),\n",

We now prove an O.m˛.n// time bound for the \\nconverted sequence and appeal to Lemma 19.7 to prove the O.m 0 ˛.n// running \\ntime of the original sequence of m 0 operations. \\nPotential function \\nThe potential function we use assigns a potential � q .x/ to each node x in the \\ndisjoint-set forest after q operations. For the potential ˆ q of the entire forest after \\nq operations, sum the individual node potentials: ˆ q D P \\nx � q .x/. Because the \\nforest is empty before the ûrst operation, the sum is taken over an empty set, and \\nso ˆ 0 D 0.

Thus, t he difference \\nbetween x: rank and x: p: rank monotonically increases over time.

Once we understand how each operation can change the potential, we can \\ndetermine the amortized costs. \\nLemma 19.10 \\nLet x be a node that is not a root, and suppose that the qth operation is either a \\nLINK or a FIND -SET. Then after the qth operation, � q .x/ හ � q\\ue0021 .x/. Moreover, \\nif x: rank \\ue004 1 and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes due to the qth operation, then \\n� q .x/ හ � q\\ue0021 .x/ \\ue003 1. That is, x ’s potential cannot increase, and if it has positive \\nrank and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes, then x ’s potential drops by at least 1. \\nProof Because x is not a root, the qth operation does not change x: rank, and \\nbecause n does not change after the initial n MAKE-SET operations, ˛.n/ remains \\nunchanged as well. Hence, these components of the f ormula for x ’s potential re- \\nmain the same after the qth operation. If x: rank D 0, then � q .x/ D � q\\ue0021 .x/ D 0. \\nNow assume that x: rank \\ue004 1. Recall that level .x/ monotonically increases \\nover time. If the qth operation leaves level .x/ unchanged, then iter .x/ either in- \\ncreases or remains unchanged. If both level .x/ and iter.x/ are unchanged, then \\n� q .x/ D � q\\ue0021 .x/. If level.x/ is unchanged and iter.x/ increases, then it increases \\nby at least 1, and so � q .x/ හ � q\\ue0021 .x/ \\ue003 1. \\nFinally, if the qth operation increases level.x/, it increases by at least 1, so that \\nthe value of the term .˛.n/ \\ue003 level.x// \\ue001 x: rank drops by at least x: rank.

This operation creates \\nnode x with rank 0, so that � q .x/ D 0. No other ranks or potentials change, and \\nso ˆ q D ˆ q\\ue0021 . Noting that the actual cost of the M AKE-SET operation is O.1/ \\ncompletes the proof. \\nLemma 19.12 \\nThe amortized cost of each LINK operation is O.˛.n//. \\nProof Suppose that the qth operation is LINK.x;y/. The actual cost of the LINK \\noperation is O.1/. Without loss of generality, suppose that the L INK makes y the \\nparent of x . \\nTo determine the change in potential due to the L INK, note that the only nodes \\nwhose potentials may change are x , y , and the children of y just prior to the oper- \\nation. We’ll show that the only node whose potential can increase due to the LINK \\nis y , and that its increase is at most ˛.n/: \\n\\ue001 By Lemma 19.10, any node that is y ’s child just before the LINK cannot have \\nits potential increase due to the LINK. \\n\\ue001 From the deûnition (19.7) of � q .x/, note that, since x was a root just before \\nthe qth operation, � q\\ue0021 .x/ D ˛.n/ \\ue001 x: rank at that time.

Otherwise, \\n� q .x/ < ˛.n/ \\ue001 x: rank (by Corollary 19.9) \\nD � q\\ue0021 .x/; \\nand so x ’s potential decreases. \\n\\ue001 Because y is a root prior to the L INK, � q\\ue0021 .y/ D ˛.n/ \\ue001 y: rank. After the \\nLINK operation, y remains a root, so that y ’s potential still equals ˛.n/ times \\nits rank after the operation.

Severa l other graph algorithms elabo- \\nrate on basic graph searching. Techniques for searc hing a graph lie at the heart of \\nthe ûeld of graph algorithms. \\nSection 20.1 discusses the two most common computational representations of \\ngraphs: as adjacency lists and as adjacency matrices.

For each u 2 V , the adjacency \\nlist AdjŒu� contains all the vertices v such that there is an edge .u;v/ 2 E. That \\nis, AdjŒu� consists of all the vertices adjacent to u in G. (Alternatively, it can con- \\ntain pointers to these vertices.) Since the adjacen cy lists represent the edges of a \\ngraph, our pseudocode treats the array Adj as an attribute of the graph, just like \\nthe edge set E.

Finding \\neach edge in the graph also takes ‚.V C E/ time, rather than just ‚.E/, since each \\nof the jV j adjacency lists must be examined. Of course, if jEj D �.V / 4such as \\nin a connected, undirected graph or a strongly connected, directed graph4we can \\nsay that ûnding each edge takes ‚.E/ time. \\nAdjacency lists can also represent \\nweighted graphs, that is, graphs for which \\neach edge has an associated weight given by a weight function w W E ! R. For \\nexample, let G D .V;E/ be a weighted graph with weight function w. Then you \\ncan simply store the weight w.u;v/ of the edge .u;v/ 2 E with vertex v in u’s \\nadjacency list. The adjacency-list representation is quite robust in that you can \\nmodify it to support many other graph variants. \\nA potential disadvantage of the adjacency-list representation is that it provides \\nno quicker way to determine whether a given edge .u;v/ is present in the graph \\nthan to search for v in the adjacency list AdjŒu�. An adjacency-matrix representa- \\ntion of the graph remedies this disadvantage, but at the cost of using asymptotically \\nmore memory. (See Exercise 20.1-8 for suggestions of variations on adjacency lists \\nthat permit faster edge lookup.) \\nThe adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G D .V;E/ assumes that the \\nvertices are numbered 1;2;:::;  jV j in some arbitrary manner. Then the adjacency- \\nmatrix representation of a graph G consists of a jV j \\ue005 jV j matrix A D .a ij / such \\nthat \\na ij D \\n( \\n1 if .i;j/ 2 E; \\n0 otherwise : \\nFigures 20.1(c) and 20.2(c) are the adjacency matrices of the undirected and di- \\nrected graphs in Figures 20.1(a) and 20.2(a), respectively . The adjacency matrix of \\na graph requires ‚.V 2 / memory, independent of the number of edges in the graph. \\nBecause ûnding each edge in the graph requires examining the entire adjacency \\nmatrix, doing so takes ‚.V 2 / time. \\nObserve the symmetry along the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix in Fig- \\nure 20.1(c). Since in an undirected graph, .u;v/ and .v;u/ represent the same \\nedge, the adjacency matrix A of an undirected graph is its own transpose: A D A T . \\nIn some applications, it pays to store only the entries on and above the diagonal of \\nthe adjacency matrix, thereby cutting the memory needed to store the graph almost \\nin half. \\nLike the adjacency-list representation of a graph, an adjacency matrix can rep- \\nresent a weighted graph. For example, if G D .V;E/ is a weighted graph with \\nedge-weight function w, you can store the weight w.u;v/ of the edge .u;v/ 2 E '),\n",

If an edge does not \\nexist, you can store a NIL value as its corresponding matrix entry, though for many \\nproblems it is convenient to use a value such as 0 or 1. \\nAlthough the adjacency-list representation is asymptotically at least as space- \\nefûcient as the adjacency-matrix representation, adjacency matrices are simpler, \\nand so you might prefer them when graphs are reason ably small. Moreover, adja- \\ncency matrices carry a further advantage for unweighted graphs: they require only \\none bit per entry. \\nRepresenting attributes \\nMost algorithms that operate on graphs need to main tain attributes for vertices \\nand/or edges. We indicate these attributes using ou r usual notation, such as v: d \\nfor an attribute d of a vertex v. When we indicate edges as pairs of vertices, we \\nuse the same style of notation. For example, if edg es have an attribute f , then we \\ndenote this attribute for edge .u;v/ by .u;v/: f . For the purpose of presenting and \\nunderstanding algorithms, our attribute notation sufûces. \\nImplementing vertex and edge attributes in real pro grams can be another story \\nentirely. There is no one best way to store and acc ess vertex and edge attributes. \\nFor a given situation, your decision will likely de pend on th e programming lan- \\nguage you are using, the algorithm you are implemen ting, and how the rest of \\nyour program uses the graph. If you represent a gra ph using adjacency lists, \\none design choice is to represent vertex attributes  in additional arrays, such as \\nan array dŒ1 W jV j� that parallels the Adj array. If the vertices adjacent to u belong \\nto AdjŒu�, then the attribute u: d can actually be stored in the array entry d Œu�. Many \\nother ways of implementing attributes are possible.

Prim’s minimum-spanning- \\ntree algorithm (Section 21.2) and Dijkstra’s single-source shortest-paths algorithm \\n(Section 22.3) use ideas similar to those in breadth-ûrst search. \\nGiven a graph G D .V;E/ and a distinguished source vertex s , breadth-ûrst \\nsearch systematically explores the edges of G to <discover= every vertex that is \\nreachable from s . It computes the distance from s to each reachable vertex, where \\nthe distance to a vertex v equals the smallest number of edges needed to go from s \\nto v. Breadth-ûrst search also produces a <breadth-ûrst tree= with root s that con- \\ntains all reachable vertices. For any vertex v reachable from s , the simple path in \\nthe breadth-ûrst tree from s to v corresponds to a shortest path from s to v in G, \\nthat is, a path containing the smallest number of e dges. The algorithm works on \\nboth directed and undirected graphs. \\nBreadth-ûrst search is so named because it expands the frontier between discov- \\nered and undiscovered vertices uniformly across the  breadth of the frontier. You \\ncan think of it as discovering vertices in waves emanating from the source vertex. \\nThat is, starting from s , the algorithm ûrst discovers all neighbors of s , which have \\ndistance 1. Then it discovers all vertices with distance 2, then all vertices with \\ndistance 3, and so on, until it has discovered every vertex reachable from s . \\nIn order to keep track of the waves of vertices, breadth-ûrst search could main- \\ntain separate arrays or lists of the vertices at each distance from the source vertex. \\nInstead, it uses a single ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue (see Section 10.1.3) containing some \\nvertices at a distance k, possibly followed by some vertices at distance k C 1. The \\nqueue, therefore, contains portions of two consecutive waves at any time. \\nTo keep track of progress, breadth-ûrst search colors each vertex white, gray, \\nor black. All vertices start out white, and vertice s not reachable from the source \\nvertex s stay white the entire time. A vertex that is reacha ble from s is discovered \\nthe ûrst time it is encountered during the search, at which time it becomes gray, in- \\ndicating that is now on the frontier of the search: the boundary between discovered \\nand undiscovered vertices. The queue contains all t he gray vertices. Eventually, \\nall the edges of a gray vertex will be explored, so  that all of its neighbors will be '),\n",

Once all of a vertex’s edges have been explored, the vertex is behind \\nthe frontier of the search, and it goes from gray to black. 1 \\nBreadth-ûrst search constructs a breadth-ûrst tree, initially containing only its \\nroot, which is the source vertex s . Whenever the search discovers a white vertex v \\nin the course of scanning the adjacency list of a g ray vertex u, the vertex v and \\nthe edge .u;v/ are added to the tree. We say that u is the predecessor or parent \\nof v in the breadth-ûrst tree. Since every vertex reachable from s is discovered \\nat most once, each vertex reachable from s has exactly one parent. (There is one \\nexception: because s is the root of the breadth-ûrst tree, it has no parent.) Ancestor \\nand descendant relationships in the breadth-ûrst tree are deûned relative to the \\nroot s as usual: if u is on the simple path in the tree from the root s to vertex v, \\nthen u is an ancestor of v and v is a descendant of u. \\nThe breadth-ûrst-search procedure BFS on the following page assumes that the \\ngraph G D .V;E/ is represented using adjacency lists. It denotes the queue by Q, \\nand it attaches three additional attributes to each vertex v in the graph: \\n\\ue001 v: color is the color of v: WHITE , GRAY, or BLACK. \\n\\ue001 v: d holds the distance from the source vertex s to v, as computed by the algo- \\nrithm. \\n\\ue001 v:� is v’s predecessor in the breadth-ûrst tree. If v has no predecessor because \\nit is the source vertex or is undiscovered, then v:� D NIL . \\nFigure 20.3 illustrates the progress of BFS on an undirected graph. \\nThe procedure BFS works as follows. With the exception of the source vertex s , \\nlines 134 paint every vertex white, set u: d D 1  for each vertex u, and set the \\nparent of every vertex to be NIL . Because the source vertex s is always the ûrst \\nvertex discovered, lines 537 paint s gray, set s: d to 0, and set the predecessor of s \\nto NIL . Lines 839 create the queue Q, initially containing just the source vertex. \\nThe while loop of lines 10318 iterates as long as there remain gray vertices, \\nwhich are on the frontier: discovered vertices that have not yet had their adjacency \\nlists fully examined. This while loop maintains the following invariant: \\nAt the test in line 10, the queue Q consists of the set of gray vertices. \\nAlthough we won’t use this loop invariant to prove correctness, it is easy to see \\nthat it holds prior to the ûrst iteration and that each iteration of the loop maintains \\nthe invariant. Prior to the ûrst iteration, the only gray vertex, and the only vertex \\n1 We distinguish between gray and black vertices to h elp us und erstand how breadth-ûrst search \\noperates.

We use aggregate \\nanalysis, as we saw in Section 16.1. After initialization, breadth-ûrst search never \\nwhitens a vertex, and thus the test in line 13 ensures that each vertex is enqueued \\nat most once, and hence dequeued at most once. The operations of enqueuing \\nand dequeuing take O.1/ time, and so the total time devoted to queue operat ions \\nis O.V/. Because the procedure scans the adjacency list of each vertex only when \\nthe vertex is dequeued, it scans each adjacency lis t at most once. Since the sum \\nof the lengths of all jV j adjacency lists is ‚.E/, the total time spent in scanning \\nadjacency lists is O.V C E/. The overhead for initialization is O.V/, and thus the \\ntotal running time of the BFS procedure is O.V C E/. Thus, breadth-ûrst search \\nruns in time linear in the size of the adjacency-list representation of G. \\nShortest paths \\nNow, let’s see why breadth-ûrst search ûnds the shortest distance from a given \\nsource vertex s to each vertex in a graph. Deûne the shortest-path distance ı.s;v/ \\nfrom s to v as the minimum number of edges in any path from vertex s to vertex v. \\nIf there is no path from s to v, then ı.s;v/ D 1. We call a path of length ı.s;v/ \\nfrom s to v a shortest path 2 from s to v. Before showing that breadth-ûrst search \\ncorrectly computes shortest-path distances, we investigate an important property \\nof shortest-path distances. \\nLemma 20.1 \\nLet G D .V;E/ be a directed or undirected graph, and let s 2 V be an arbitrary \\nvertex. Then, for any edge .u;v/ 2 E, \\nı.s;v/ හ ı.s;u/ C 1: \\nProof If u is reachable from s , then so is v. In this case, the shortest path from s \\nto v cannot be longer than the shortest path from s to u followed by the edge .u;v/, \\nand thus the inequality holds. If u is not reachable from s , then ı.s;u/ D 1, and \\nagain, the inequality holds. \\nOur goal is to show that the BFS procedure properly computes v: d D ı.s;v/ \\nfor each vertex v 2 V . We ûrst show that v: d bounds ı.s;v/ from above. \\n2 Chapters 22 and 23 generalize shortest paths to weighted graphs, in which every edge has a real- \\nvalued weight and the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. The graphs \\nconsidered in the present chapter are unweighted or, equivalently, all edges have unit weight. '),\n",

Then, for each vertex v 2 V , the value v: d \\ncomputed by BFS satisûes v: d \\ue004 ı.s;v/ at all times, including at termination. \\nProof The lemma is true intuitively, because any ûnite value assigned to v: d \\nequals the number of edges on some path from s to v. The formal proof is by \\ninduction on the number of ENQUEUE operations. The inductive hypothesis is that \\nv: d \\ue004 ı.s;v/ for all v 2 V . \\nThe base case of the induction is the situation immediately after enqueuing s in \\nline 9 of BFS. The inductive hypothesis holds here,  because s: d D 0 D ı.s;s/ \\nand v: d D 1 \\ue004 ı.s;v/ for all v 2 V \\ue003 fs g. \\nFor the inductive step, consider a white vertex v that is discovered during the \\nsearch from a vertex u. The inductive hypothesis implies that u: d \\ue004 ı.s;u/. The \\nassignment performed by line 15 and Lemma 20.1 give \\nv: d D u: d C 1 \\n\\ue004 ı.s;u/ C 1 \\n\\ue004 ı.s;v/:  \\nVertex v is then enqueued, and it is never enqueued again because it is also grayed \\nand lines 14317 execute only for white vertices. Thus, the value of v: d never \\nchanges again, and the inductive hypothesis is maintained. \\nTo prove that v: d D ı.s;v/, we ûrst show more precisely how the queue Q \\noperates during the course of BFS. The next lemma s hows that at all times, \\nthe d values of vertices in the queue either are all the same or form a sequence \\nhk;k;:::;k;k  C 1;k C 1;:::;k  C 1i for some integer k \\ue004 0. \\nLemma 20.3 \\nSuppose that during the execution of BFS on a graph  G D .V;E/, the queue Q \\ncontains the vertices hv 1 ;v 2 ;:::;v  r i, where v 1 is the head of Q and v r is the tail. \\nThen, v r : d හ v 1 : d C 1 and v i : d හ v i C1 : d for i D 1;2;:::;r  \\ue003 1. \\nProof The proof is by induction on the number of queue op erations. Initially, \\nwhen the queue contains only s , the lemma trivially holds. \\nFor the inductive step, we must prove that the lemma holds after both dequeuing \\nand enqueuing a vertex. First, we examine dequeuing . When the head v 1 of the \\nqueue is dequeued, v 2 becomes the new head. (If the queue becomes empty, then \\nthe lemma holds vacuously.) By the inductive hypoth esis, v 1 : d හ v 2 : d. But then \\nwe have v r : d හ v 1 : d C1 හ v 2 : d C1, and the remaining inequalities are unaffected. \\nThus, the lemma follows with v 2 as the new head. '),\n",

When line 17 of BFS enqueues a vertex v onto \\na queue containing vertices hv 1 ;v 2 ;:::;v  r i, the enqueued vertex becomes v r C1 . \\nIf the queue was empty before v was enqueued, then after enqueuing v, we have \\nr D 1 and the lemma trivially holds. Now suppose that the  queue was nonempty \\nwhen v was enqueued. At that time, the procedure has most recently removed \\nvertex u, whose adjacency list is currently being scanned, from the queue Q. Just \\nbefore u was removed, we had u D v 1 and the inductive hypothesis held, so that \\nu: d හ v 2 : d and v r : d හ u: d C 1. After u is removed from the queue, the vertex \\nthat had been v 2 becomes the new head v 1 of the queue, so that now u: d හ v 1 : d. \\nThus, v r C1 : d D v: d D u: d C 1 හ v 1 : d C 1. Since v r : d හ u: d C 1, we have \\nv r : d හ u: d C 1 D v: d D v r C1 : d, and the remaining inequalities are unaffected. \\nThus, the lemma follows when v is enqueued. \\nThe following corollary shows that the d values at the time that vertices are \\nenqueued monotonically increase over time. \\nCorollary 20.4 \\nSuppose that vertices v i and v j are enqueued during the execution of BFS, and \\nthat v i is enqueued before v j . Then v i : d හ v j : d at the time that v j is enqueued. \\nProof Immediate from Lemma 20.3 and the property that each vertex receives a \\nûnite d value at most once during the course of BFS. \\nWe can now prove that breadth-ûrst search correctly ûnds shortest-path dis- \\ntances. \\nTheorem 20.5 (Correctness of breadth-ûrst search) \\nLet G D .V;E/ be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that  BFS is run \\non G from a given source vertex s 2 V .

If v is black, \\nthen it was already removed from the queue and, by Corollary 2 0.4, we have \\nv: d හ u: d, again contradicting inequality (20.1). If v is gray, then it was painted \\ngray upon dequeuing some vertex w, which was removed from Q earlier than u \\nand for which v: d D w: d C 1. By Corollary 20.4, however, w: d හ u: d, and so \\nv: d D w: d C 1 හ u: d C 1, once again contradicting inequality (20.1). \\nThus we conclude that v: d D ı.s;v/ for all v 2 V .

The algorithm repeats this entire  process until it has discovered \\nevery vertex. 3 \\nAs in breadth-ûrst search, whenever depth-ûrst search discovers a vertex v dur- \\ning a scan of the adjacency list of an already disc overed vertex u, it records this \\nevent by setting v’s predecessor attribute v:� to u. Unlike breadth-ûrst search, \\nwhose predecessor subgraph forms a tree, depth-ûrst search produces a predeces- \\nsor subgraph that might contain several trees, because the search may repeat from \\nmultiple sources. Therefore, we deûne the predecessor subgraph of a depth-ûrst \\nsearch slightly differently from that of a breadth-ûrst search: it always includes all \\nvertices, and it accounts for multiple sources. Speciûcally, for a depth-ûrst search \\nthe predecessor subgraph is G \\ue003 D .V;E \\ue003 /, where \\nE \\ue003 D f.v:�; v/  W v 2 V and v:� ¤ NIL g : \\nThe predecessor subgraph of a depth-ûrst search forms a depth-ûrst forest com- \\nprising several depth-ûrst trees. The edges in E \\ue003 are tree edges. \\nLike breadth-ûrst search, depth-ûrst search colors vertices during the search to \\nindicate their state. Each vertex is initially whit e, is grayed when it is discovered \\nin the search, and is blackened when it is ûnished, that is, when its adjacency list \\nhas been examined completely. This technique guarantees that each vertex ends up \\nin exactly one depth-ûrst tree, so that these trees are disjoint. \\nBesides creating a depth-ûrst forest, depth-ûrst search also timestamps each ver- \\ntex. Each vertex v has two timestamps: the ûrst timestamp v: d records when v \\nis ûrst discovered (and grayed), and the second timestamp v: f records when the \\nsearch ûnishes examining v’s adjacency list (and blackens v). These timestamps \\nprovide important information about the structure o f the graph and are generally \\nhelpful in reasoning about the behavior of depth-ûrst search. \\nThe procedure DFS on the facing page records when i t discovers vertex u in \\nthe attribute u: d and when it ûnishes vertex u in the attribute u: f . These time- \\nstamps are integers between 1 and 2 jV j, since there is one discovery event and one \\nûnishing event for each of the jV j vertices. For every vertex u, \\nu: d <u: f : (20.4) \\nVertex u is WHITE before time u: d, GRAY between time u: d and time u: f , and \\nBLACK thereafter.

The running time of \\nDFS is therefore ‚.V C E/. \\nProperties of depth-ﬁrst search \\nDepth-ûrst search yields valuable information about the structure of a graph. Per- \\nhaps the most basic property of depth-ûrst search is that the predecessor sub- \\ngraph G \\ue003 does indeed form a forest of trees, since the struc ture of the depth- \\nûrst trees exactly mirrors the structure of recursive calls of DFS-VISIT . That is, \\nu D v:� if and only if DFS-VISIT .G;v/ was called during a search of u’s ad- \\njacency list. Additionally, vertex v is a descendant of vertex u in the depth-ûrst \\nforest if and only if v is discovered during the time in which u is gray. \\nAnother important property of depth-ûrst search is that discovery and ûnish \\ntimes have parenthesis structure. If the DFS-VISIT procedure were to print a left \\nparenthesis <.u= when it discovers vertex u and to print a right parenthesis < u/= \\nwhen it ûnishes u, then the printed expression would be well formed in the sense \\nthat the parentheses are properly nested. For examp le, the d epth-ûrst search of \\nFigure 20.5(a) corresponds to the parenthesization shown in Figure 20.5(b). The \\nfollowing theorem provides another way to characterize the parenthesis structure. \\nTheorem 20.7 (Parenthesis theorem) \\nIn any depth-ûrst search of a (directed or undirected) graph G D .V;E/, for any \\ntwo vertices u and v, exactly one of the following three conditions holds: \\n\\ue001 the intervals Œu: d;u: f � and Œv: d;v: f � are entirely disjoint, and neither u nor v \\nis a descendant of the other in the depth-ûrst forest, \\n\\ue001 the interval Œu: d;u: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œv: d;v: f �, and u \\nis a descendant of v in a depth-ûrst tree, or \\n\\ue001 the interval Œv: d;v: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œu: d;u: f �, and v \\nis a descendant of u in a depth-ûrst tree. \\nProof We begin with the case in which u: d < v: d. We consider two subcases, \\naccording to whether v: d <u: f . The ûrst subcase occurs when v: d <u: f , so that \\nv was discovered while u was still gray, which implies that v is a descendant of u. \\nMoreover, since v was discovered after u, all of its outgoing edges are explored, \\nand v is ûnished, before the search returns to and ûnishes u. In this case, therefore, \\nthe interval Œv: d;v: f � is entirely contained within the interval Œu: d;u: f �. In the \\nother subcase, u: f < v: d, and by inequality (20.4), u: d < u: f < v: d < v: f , \\nand thus the intervals Œu: d;u: f � and Œv: d;v: f � are disjoint. Because the intervals \\nare disjoint, neither vertex was discovered while the other was gray, and so neither \\nvertex is a descendant of the other. '),\n",

Now, suppose that v is a proper descendant \\nof u in the depth-ûrst forest. By Corollary 20.8, u: d < v: d, and so v is white at \\ntime u: d. Since v can be any descendant of u, all vertices on the unique simple \\npath from u to v in the depth-ûrst forest are white at time u: d. \\n(: Suppose that there is a path of white vertices from u to v at time u: d, but v \\ndoes not become a descendant of u in the depth-ûrst tree. Without loss of gener- \\nality, assume that every vertex other than v along the path becomes a descendant \\nof u. (Otherwise, let v be the closest vertex to u along the path that doesn’t be- \\ncome a descendant of u.) Let w be the predecessor of v in the path, so that w is \\na descendant of u (w and u may in fact be the same vertex). By Corollary 20.8, \\nw: f හ u: f . Because v must be discovered after u is discovered, but before w is \\nûnished, u: d < v: d < w: f හ u: f . Theorem 20.7 then implies that the interval \\nŒv: d;v: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œu: d;u: f �.

For example, Section 20.4 will show that a directed graph is \\nacyclic if and only if a depth-ûrst search yields no <back= edges (Lemma 20.11). \\nThe depth-ûrst forest G \\ue003 produced by a depth-ûrst search on graph G can con- \\ntain four types of edges: \\n1. \\nTree edges are edges in the depth-ûrst forest G \\ue003 .

Figure 20.5(c) also shows \\nhow to redraw the graph of Figure 20.5(a) so that all tree and forward edges head \\ndownward in a depth-ûrst tree and all back edges go up. You can redraw any graph \\nin this fashion. \\nThe DFS algorithm has enough information to classify some edges as it encoun- \\nters them. The key idea is that when an edge .u;v/ is ûrst explored, the color of \\nvertex v says something about the edge: \\n1. WHITE indicates a tree edge, \\n2. GRAY indicates a back edge, and \\n3. BLACK indicates a forward or cross edge. \\nThe ûrst case is immediate from the speciûcation of the algorithm. For the sec- \\nond case, observe that the gray vertices always form a linear chain of descendants \\ncorresponding to the stack of active DFS-VISIT invocations. The number of gray \\nvertices is 1 more than the depth in the depth-ûrst forest of the vertex most recently \\ndiscovered. Depth-ûrst search always explores from the deepest gray vertex, so \\nthat an edge that reaches another gray vertex has r eached an ancestor. The third \\ncase handles the remaining possibility. Exercise 20.3-5 asks you to show that such \\nan edge .u;v/ is a forward edge if u: d <v: d and a cross edge if u: d >v: d. \\nAccording to the following theorem, forward and cro ss edges never occur in a \\ndepth-ûrst search of an undirected graph. \\nTheorem 20.10 \\nIn a depth-ûrst search of an undirected graph G, every edge of G is either a tree \\nedge or a back edge. \\nProof Let .u;v/ be an arbitrary edge of G, and suppose without loss of generality \\nthat u: d < v: d. Then, while u is gray, the search must discover and ûnish v \\nbefore it ûnishes u, since v is on u’s adjacency list. If the ûrst time that the search \\nexplores edge .u;v/, it is in the direction from u to v, then v is undiscovered \\n(white) until that time, for otherwise the search w ould have explored this edge \\nalready in the direction from v to u. Thus, .u;v/ becomes a tree edge. If the \\nsearch explores .u;v/ ûrst in the direction from v to u, then .u;v/ is a back edge, \\nsince there must be a path of tree edges from u to v. \\nSince .u;v/ and .v;u/ are really the same edge in an undirected graph, the proof \\nof Theorem 20.10 says how to classify the edge. When searching from a vertex, \\nwhich must be gray, if the adjacent vertex is white , then the edge is a tree edge. \\nOtherwise, the edge is a back edge. \\nThe next two sections apply the above theorems about depth-ûrst search.

A topological sort \\nof a dag G D .V;E/ is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if G contains \\nan edge .u;v/, then u appears before v in the ordering. Topological sorting is \\ndeûned only on directed graphs that are acyclic; no linear ordering is possible \\nwhen a directed graph contains a cycle.

Thus, u and v 0 are reachable from each other, thereby contradicting \\nthe assumption that C and C 0 are distinct strongly connected components. \\nBecause the S TRONGLY-CONNECTED -COMPONENTS  procedure performs two \\ndepth-ûrst searches, there are two distinct sets of discovery and ûnish times. In this \\nsection, discovery and ûnish times always refer to those computed by the ﬁrst call \\nof DFS, in line 1. \\nThe notation for discovery and ûnish times extends to sets of vertices.

Suppose that there is an edge .u;v/ 2 E, where u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Then \\nf.C 0 />f.C/ . \\nProof We consider two cases, depending on which strongly connected compo- \\nnent, C or C 0 , had the ûrst discovered vertex during the ûrst depth-ûrst search. \\nIf d.C 0 /<d.C/ , let x be the ûrst vertex discovered in C 0 . At time x: d, all ver- \\ntices in C and C 0 are white. At that time, G contains a path from x to each vertex \\nin C 0 consisting only of white vertices. Because .u;v/ 2 E, for any vertex w 2 C , \\nthere is also a path in G at time x: d from x to w consisting only of white vertices: \\nx ❀ u ! v ❀ w. By the white-path theorem, all vertices in C and C 0 become \\ndescendants of x in the depth-ûrst tree.

At time y: f , therefore, all vertices in C 0 are still white. Thus, for any \\nvertex w 2 C 0 , we have w: f >y: f , which implies that f.C 0 />f.C/ . \\nCorollary 20.15 \\nLet C and C 0 be distinct strongly connected components in direct ed graph G D \\n.V;E/, and suppose that f.C/ > f.C 0 /. Then E T contains no edge .v;u/ such \\nthat u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . \\nProof The contrapositive of Lemma 20.14 says that if f.C 0 /<f.C/ , then there \\nis no edge .u;v/ 2 E such that u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Because the strongly connected \\ncomponents of G and G T are the same, if there is no such edge .u;v/ 2 E, then \\nthere is no edge .v;u/ 2 E T such that u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . \\nCorollary 20.15 provides the key to understanding why the strongly connected \\ncomponents algorithm works. Let9s examine what happens during the second \\ndepth-ûrst search, which is on G T . The search starts from the vertex x whose \\nûnish time from the ûrst depth-ûrst search is maximum. This vertex belongs to \\nsome strongly connected component C , and since x: f is maximum, f.C/ is max- \\nimum over all strongly connected components. When t he search starts from x , it \\nvisits all vertices in C . By Corollary 20.15, G T contains no edges from C to any \\nother strongly connected component, and so the search from x never visits vertices \\nin any other component. Thus, the tree rooted at x contains exactly the vertices \\nof C . Having completed visiting all vertices in C , the second depth-ûrst search \\nselects as a new root a vertex from some other stro ngly connected component C 0 \\nwhose ûnish time f.C 0 / is maximum over all components other than C . Again, \\nthe search visits all vertices in C 0 . But by Corollary 20.15, if any edges in G T go \\nfrom C 0 to any other component, they must go to C , which the second depth-ûrst \\nsearch has already visited. In general, when the depth-ûrst search of G T in line 3 \\nvisits any strongly connected component, any edges out of that component must be \\nto components that the search has already visited. Each depth-ûrst tree, therefore, \\ncorresponds to exactly one strongly connected component. The following theorem \\nformalizes this argument. \\nTheorem 20.16 \\nThe S TRONGLY-CONNECTED -COMPONENTS  procedure correctly computes the \\nstrongly connected components of the directed graph G provided as its input. \\nProof We argue by induction on the number of depth-ûrst trees found in the \\ndepth-ûrst search of G T in line 3 that the vertices of each tree form a strongly \\nconnected component. The inductive hypothesis is that the ûrst k trees produced '),\n",

The basis for the induction, when \\nk D 0, is trivial. \\nIn the inductive step, we assume that each of the ûrst k depth-ûrst trees pro- \\nduced in line 3 is a strongly connected component, and we consider the .k C 1/st \\ntree produced. Let the root of this tree be vertex u, and let u be in strongly con- \\nnected component C . Because of how the depth-ûrst search chooses roots in line 3, \\nu: f D f.C/>f.C  0 / for any strongly connected component C 0 other than C that \\nhas yet to be visited. By the inductive hypothesis,  at the tim e that the search vis- \\nits u, all other vertices of C are white. By the white-path theorem, therefore, all \\nother vertices of C are descendants of u in its depth-ûrst tree. Moreover, by the \\ninductive hypothesis and by Corollary 20.15, any edges in G T that leave C must be \\nto strongly connected components that have already been visited. Thus, no vertex \\nin any strongly connected component other than C is a descendant of u during the \\ndepth-ûrst search of G T . The vertices of the depth-ûrst tree in G T that is rooted \\nat u form exactly one strongly connected component, which completes the induc- \\ntive step and the proof. \\nHere is another way to look at how the second depth-ûrst search operates. Con- \\nsider the component graph .G T / SCC of G T . If you map each strongly connected \\ncomponent visited in the second depth-ûrst search to a vertex of .G T / SCC , the sec- \\nond depth-ûrst search visits vertices of .G T / SCC in the reverse of a topologically \\nsorted order. If you reverse the edges of .G T / SCC , you get the graph ..G T / SCC / T . \\nBecause ..G T / SCC / T D G SCC (see Exercise 20.5-4), the second depth-ûrst search \\nvisits the vertices of G SCC in topologically sorted order. \\nExercises \\n20.5-1 \\nHow can the number of strongly connected components of a graph change if a new \\nedge is added? \\n20.5-2 \\nShow how the procedure S TRONGLY-CONNECTED -COMPONENTS  works on the \\ngraph of Figure 20.6.

For the minimum-spanning-tree problem, however, we can prove that certain \\ngreedy strategies do yield a spanning tree with minimum weight. Although you can \\nread this chapter independently of Chapter 15, the greedy methods presented here \\nare a classic application of the theoretical notions introduced there. \\nSection 21.1 introduces a <generic= minimum-spanning-tree method that grows \\na spanning tree by adding one edge at a time. Section 21.2 gives two algorithms \\nthat implement the generic method. The ûrst algorithm, due to Kruskal, is similar \\nto the connected-components algorithm from Section 19.1. The second, due to \\nPrim, resembles Dijkstra9s shortest-paths algorithm (Section 22.3). \\nBecause a tree is a type of graph, in order to be p recise we must deûne a tree \\nin terms of not just its edges, but its vertices as well. Because this chapter focuses \\non trees in terms of their edges, we9ll implicitly understand that the vertices of a \\ntree T are those that some edge of T is incident on. \\n21.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree \\nThe input to the minumum-spanning-tree problem is a connected, undirected graph \\nG D .V;E/ with a weight function w W E ! R. The goal is to ûnd a minimum \\nspanning tree for G. The two algorithms considered in this chapter use  a greedy \\napproach to the problem, although they differ in how they apply this approach. \\nThis greedy strategy is captured by the procedure GENERIC -MST on the facing \\npage, which grows the minimum spanning tree one edg e at a time. The generic \\nmethod manages a set A of edges, maintaining the following loop invariant: \\nPrior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree. '),\n",

Then, edge .u;v/ is safe for A. \\nProof Let T be a minimum spanning tree that includes A, and assume that T \\ndoes not contain the light edge .u;v/, since if it does, we are done. We9ll construct \\nanother minimum spanning tree T 0 that includes A [ f.u;v/g by using a cut-and- \\npaste technique, thereby showing that .u;v/ is a safe edge for A. \\nThe edge .u;v/ forms a cycle with the edges on the simple path p from u \\nto v in T , as Figure 21.3 illustrates. Since u and v are on opposite sides of the \\ncut .S;V \\ue003 S/, at least one edge in T lies on the simple path p and also crosses \\nthe cut. Let .x;y/ be any such edge. The edge .x;y/ is not in A, because the cut \\nrespects A. Since .x;y/ is on the unique simple path from u to v in T , remov- \\ning .x;y/ breaks T into two components. Adding .u;v/ reconnects them to form \\na new spanning tree T 0 D .T \\ue003 f.x;y/g/ [ f.u;v/g. \\nWe next show that T 0 is a minimum spanning tree. Since .u;v/ is a light edge \\ncrossing .S;V \\ue003 S/ and .x;y/ also crosses this cut, w.u;v/ හ w.x;y/. Therefore, \\nw.T 0 / D w.T/ \\ue003 w.x;y/ C w.u;v/ \\nහ w.T/:  \\nBut T is a minimum spanning tree, so that w.T/ හ w.T 0 /, and thus, T 0 must be a \\nminimum spanning tree as well. \\nIt remains to show that .u;v/ is actually a safe edge for A. We have A ෂ T 0 , \\nsince A ෂ T and .x;y/ … A, and thus, A [ f.u;v/g ෂ T 0 . Consequently, since T 0 \\nis a minimum spanning tree, .u;v/ is safe for A. \\nTheorem 21.1 provides insight into how the GENERIC -MST method works on a \\nconnected graph G D .V;E/. As the method proceeds, the set A is always acyclic, \\nsince it is a subset of a minimum spanning tree and a tree may not contain a cycle. '),\n",

Bor˚ uvka9s algorithm consists of running O.lg V/ iterations of the \\nprocedure MST-REDUCE described in Problem 21-2. Kruskal9s algorithm was \\nreported by Kruskal [272] in 1956.

For sparser graphs, using a combination of th e ideas from \\nPrim9s algorithm, Kruskal9s algorithm, and Bor˚ uvka9s algorithm, together with ad- \\nvanced data structures, Fredman and Tarjan [156] give an algorithm that runs in \\nO.E lg \\ue003 V/ time. Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan [165] improved this algo- \\nrithm to run in O.E lg lg \\ue003 V/ time. Chazelle [83] gives an algorithm that runs \\nin O.E y ˛.E;V//  time, where y ˛.E;V/  is the functional inverse of Ackermann9s \\nfunction. (See the chapter notes for Chapter 19 for a brief discussion of Acker- \\nmann9s function and its inverse.) Unlike previous minimum-spanning-tree algo- \\nrithms, Chazelle9s algorithm does not follow the greedy method. Pettie and Ra- \\nmachandran [356] give an algorithm based on precomputed <MST decision trees= \\nthat also runs in O.E y ˛.E;V//  time. \\nA related problem is spanning-tree veriûcation: given a graph G D .V;E/ and \\na tree T ෂ E, determine whether T is a minimum spanning tree of G. King [254] \\ngives a linear-time algorithm to verify a spanning tree, building on earlier work of \\nKoml´ os [269] and Dixon, Rauch, and Tarjan [120]. \\nThe above algorithms are all deterministic and fall  into the comparison-based \\nmodel described in Chapter 8.

The following lemma states the \\noptimal-substructure property of shortest paths more precisely. \\nLemma 22.1 (Subpaths of shortest paths are shortest paths) \\nGiven a weighted, directed graph G D .V;E/ with weight function w W E ! R, \\nlet p D hv 0 ;v 1 ;:::;v  k i be a shortest path from vertex v 0 to vertex v k and, for any \\ni and j such that 0 හ i හ j හ k, let p ij D hv i ;v i C1 ;:::;v  j i be the subpath of p \\nfrom vertex v i to vertex v j . Then, p ij is a shortest path from v i to v j . \\nProof Decompose path p into v 0 \\np 0i \\n❀ v i \\np ij \\n❀ v j \\np jk \\n❀ v k , so that w.p/ D w.p 0i / C \\nw.p ij / C w.p jk /.

If the graph G D .V;E/ contains no negative- \\nweight cycles reachable from the source s , then for all v 2 V , the shortest-path \\nweight ı.s;v/ remains well deûned, even if it has a negative value. If the graph \\ncontains a negative-weight cycle reachable from s , however, shortest-path weights \\nare not well deûned. No path from s to a vertex on the cycle can be a short- \\nest path4you can always ûnd a path with lower weight by following the proposed \\n<shortest= path and then traversing the negative-weight cycle. If there is a negative- \\nweight cycle on some path from s to v, we deûne ı.s;v/ D \\ue0031. \\nFigure 22.1 illustrates the effect of negative weights and negative-weight cy- \\ncles on shortest-path weights.

Typically, if there is such a negative-weight cycle, the algorithm can \\ndetect and report its existence. \\nCycles \\nCan a shortest path contain a cycle? As we have just seen, it cannot contain a \\nnegative-weight cycle. Nor can it contain a positive-weight cycle, since remov- \\ning the cycle from the path produces a path with th e same source and destination \\nvertices and a lower path weight. That is, if p D h v 0 ;v 1 ;:::;v  k i is a path and \\nc D hv i ;v i C1 ;:::;v  j i is a positive-weight cycle on this path (so that v i D v j and \\nw.c/ > 0 ), then the path p 0 D h v 0 ;v 1 ;:::;v  i ;v j C1 ;v j C2 ;:::;v  k i has weight \\nw.p 0 / D w.p/ \\ue003 w.c/<w.p/ , and so p cannot be a shortest path from v 0 to v k . \\nThat leaves only 0-weight cycles. You can remove a 0-weight cycle from any \\npath to produce another path whose weight is the same. Thus, if there is a shortest \\npath from a source vertex s to a destination vertex v that contains a 0-weight cycle, \\nthen there is another shortest path from s to v without this cycle. As long as a \\nshortest path has 0-weight cycles, you can repeatedly remove these cycles from the \\npath until you have a shortest path that is cycle-free. Therefore, without loss of '),\n",

As we shall see, with a good implementa- \\ntion, the running time of Dijkstra9s algorithm is lower than that of the Bellman-Ford \\nalgorithm. \\nYou can think of Dijkstra9s algorithm as generalizing breadth-ûrst search to \\nweighted graphs. A wave emanates from the source, and the ûrst time that a wave \\narrives at a vertex, a new wave emanates from that vertex. Whe reas breadth-ûrst \\nsearch operates as if each wave takes unit time to traverse an edge, in a weighted \\ngraph, the time for a wave to traverse an edge is g iven by the edge9s weight. Be- \\ncause a shortest path in a weighted graph might not  have the fewest edges, a sim- \\nple, ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue won9t sufûce for choosing the next vertex from which \\nto send out a wave. \\nInstead, Dijkstra9s algorithm maintains a set S of vertices whose ûnal shortest- \\npath weights from the source s have already been determined. The algorithm re- \\npeatedly selects the vertex u 2 V \\ue003 S with the minimum shortest-path estimate, \\nadds u into S , and relaxes all edges leaving u.

It maintains the min-priority queue Q by calling \\nthree priority-queue operations: I NSERT (in line 5), EXTRACT -MIN (in line 7), and \\nDECREASE -KEY (in line 12). The algorithm calls both I NSERT and E XTRACT - \\nMIN once per vertex. Because each vertex u 2 V is added to set S exactly once, \\neach edge in the adjacency list AdjŒu� is examined in the for loop of lines 9312 \\nexactly once during the course of the algorithm. Since the total number of edges in \\nall the adjacency lists is jEj, this for loop iterates a total of jEj times, and thus the \\nalgorithm calls D ECREASE -KEY at most jEj times overall. (Observe once again \\nthat we are using aggregate analysis.) \\nJust as in Prim9s algorithm, the running time of Dijkstra9s algorithm depends on \\nthe speciûc implementation of the min-priority queue Q. A simple implementation \\ntakes advantage of the vertices being numbered 1 to jV j: simply store v: d in the \\nvth entry of an array. Each I NSERT and D ECREASE -KEY operation takes O.1/ \\ntime, and each E XTRACT -MIN operation takes O.V/ time (since it has to search \\nthrough the entire array), for a total time of O.V 2 C E/ D O.V 2 /. \\nIf the graph is sufûciently sparse4in particular, E D o.V 2 = lg V/4you can \\nimprove the running time by implementing the min-priority queue with a binary \\nmin-heap that includes a way to map between vertices and their corresponding \\nheap elements. Each E XTRACT -MIN operation then takes O.lg V/ time. As be- \\nfore, there are jV j such operations. The time to build the binary min-heap is O.V/. \\n(As noted in Section 21.2, you don9t even need to call BUILD -MIN-HEAP .) Each \\nDECREASE -KEY operation takes O.lg V/ time, and there are still at most jEj \\nsuch operations. The total running time is therefor e O..V C E/ lg V/, which \\nis O.E lg V/ in the typical case that jEj D  �.V / . This running time improves \\nupon the straightforward O.V 2 /-time implementation if E D o.V 2 = lg V/. '),\n",

The amortized cost of each \\nof the jV j EXTRACT -MIN operations is O.lg V/, and each D ECREASE -KEY call, \\nof which there are at most jEj, takes only O.1/ amortized time. Historically, the \\ndevelopment of Fibonacci heaps was motivated by the  observation that Dijkstra9s \\nalgorithm typically makes many more DECREASE -KEY calls than EXTRACT -MIN \\ncalls, so that any method of reducing the amortized time of each D ECREASE -KEY \\noperation to o.lg V/ without increasing the amortized time of E XTRACT -MIN \\nwould yield an asymptotically faster implementation than with binary heaps. \\nDijkstra9s algorithm resembles both breadth-ûrst search (see Section 20.2) and \\nPrim9s algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees (see Section 21.2). It is \\nlike breadth-ûrst search in that set S corresponds to the set of black vertices in a \\nbreadth-ûrst search. Just as vertices in S have their ûnal shortest-path weights, so \\ndo black vertices in a breadth-ûrst search have their correct breadth-ûrst distances. \\nDijkstra9s algorithm is like Prim9s algorithm in that both algorithms use a min- \\npriority queue to ûnd the <lightest= vertex outside a given set (the set S in Dijkstra9s \\nalgorithm and the tree being grown in Prim9s algorithm), add this vertex into the \\nset, and adjust the weights of the remaining vertices outside the set accordingly. \\nExercises \\n22.3-1 \\nRun Dijkstra9s algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 22.2, ûrst using vertex s \\nas the source and then using vertex ´ as the source.

Consider any edge \\n.v i ;v j / 2 E. The triangle inequality implies that ı.v 0 ;v j / හ ı.v 0 ;v i / C w.v i ;v j /, \\nwhich is equivalent to ı.v 0 ;v j /\\ue003ı.v 0 ;v i / හ w.v i ;v j /. Thus, letting x i D ı.v 0 ;v i / \\nand x j D ı.v 0 ;v j / satisûes the difference constraint x j \\ue003 x i හ w.v i ;v j / that cor- \\nresponds to edge .v i ;v j /. \\nNow we show that if the constraint graph contains a negative-weight cycle, then \\nthe system of difference constraints has no feasible solution. Without loss of gen- \\nerality, let the negative-weight cycle be c D h v 1 ;v 2 ;:::;v  k i, where v 1 D v k . \\n(The vertex v 0 cannot be on cycle c , because it has no entering edges.) Cycle c \\ncorresponds to the following difference constraints: \\nx 2 \\ue003 x 1 හ w.v 1 ;v 2 /; \\nx 3 \\ue003 x 2 හ w.v 2 ;v 3 /; \\n: : : \\nx k\\ue0021 \\ue003 x k\\ue0022 හ w.v k\\ue0022 ;v k\\ue0021 /; \\nx k \\ue003 x k\\ue0021 හ w.v k\\ue0021 ;v k /: \\nWe9ll assume that x has a solution satisfying each of these k inequalities and then \\nderive a contradiction. The solution must also sati sfy the inequality that results \\nfrom summing the k inequalities together. In summing the left-hand sides, each \\nunknown x i is added in once and subtracted out once (remember that v 1 D v k \\nimplies x 1 D x k ), so that the left-hand side sums to 0. The right-hand side sums \\nto the weight w.c/ of the cycle, giving 0 හ w.c/. But since c is a negative-weight \\ncycle, w.c/<0 , and we obtain the contradiction that 0 හ w.c/<0 . \\nSolving systems of difference constraints \\nTheorem 22.9 suggests how to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve a system of \\ndifference constraints. Because the constraint graph contains edges from the source \\nvertex v 0 to all other vertices, any negative-weight cycle in the constraint graph is \\nreachable from v 0 . If the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE , then the shortest- \\npath weights give a feasible solution to the system. In Figure 22.8, for example, the \\nshortest-path weights provide the feasible solution x D .\\ue0035; \\ue0033;0; \\ue0031; \\ue0034/, and \\nby Lemma 22.8, x D .d \\ue003 5;d \\ue003 3;d;d  \\ue003 1;d \\ue003 4/ is also a feasible solution for \\nany constant d . If the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns FALSE , there is no feasible \\nsolution to the system of difference constraints. \\nA system of difference constraints with m constraints on n unknowns produces \\na graph with n C 1 vertices and n C m edges. Thus, the Bellman-Ford algorithm \\nprovides a way to solve the system in O..n C 1/.n C m// D O.n 2 C nm/ time. '),\n",

Consider a predecessor subgraph G \\ue003 that arises after a sequence of \\nrelaxation steps. We ûrst prove that G \\ue003 is acyclic. Suppose for the sake of contra- \\ndiction that some relaxation step creates a cycle in the graph G \\ue003 . Let the cycle be \\nc D hv 0 ;v 1 ;:::;v  k i, where v k D v 0 .

Each vertex on c has a non-NIL predecessor, and so each vertex on c was as- \\nsigned a ûnite shortest-path estimate when it was assigned its non-NIL � value. By \\nthe upper-bound property, each vertex on cycle c has a ûnite shortest-path weight, \\nwhich means that it is reachable from s . \\nWe9ll examine the shortest-path estimates on cycle c immediately before the call \\nRELAX .v k\\ue0021 ;v k ;w/ and show that c is a negative-weight cycle, thereby contra- \\ndicting the assumption that G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable \\nfrom the source. Just before the call, we have v i :� D v i \\ue0021 for i D 1;2;:::;k  \\ue003 1. \\nThus, for i D 1;2;:::;k  \\ue003 1, the last update to v i : d was by the assignment \\nv i : d D v i \\ue0021 : dCw.v i \\ue0021 ;v i /.

Thus, the vertices in V \\ue003 are exactly those reachable from s . \\nThe second property, that G \\ue003 forms a rooted tree with root s , follows directly \\nfrom Lemma 22.16. \\nIt remains, therefore, to prove the last property o f shortest-paths trees: for each \\nvertex v 2 V \\ue003 , the unique simple path s \\np \\n❀ v in G \\ue003 is a shortest path from s \\nto v in G. Let p D h v 0 ;v 1 ;:::;v  k i, where v 0 D s and v k D v. Consider \\nan edge .v i \\ue0021 ;v i / in path p.

You are given one additional piece of infor- \\nmation: for each vertex v 2 V , the weights of the edges along any shortest path \\nfrom s to v form a bitonic sequence. \\nGive the most efûcient algorithm you can to solve this problem, and analyze its \\nrunning time. \\nChapter notes \\nThe shortest-path problem has a long history that is nicely desribed in an article \\nby Schrijver [400].

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is based on separate \\nalgorithms by Bellman [45] and Ford [149]. The same algorithm is also attributed \\nto Moore [334]. Bellman describes the relation of shortest paths to difference con- \\nstraints. Lawler [276] describes the linear-time algorithm for shortest paths in a \\ndag, which he considers part of the folklore. \\nWhen edge weights are relatively small nonnegative integers, more efûcient al- \\ngorithms result from using min-priority queues that require integer keys and rely \\non the sequence of values returned by the E XTRACT -MIN calls in Dijkstra9s al- \\ngorithm monotonically increasing over time.

There is also a pseudopolyomial-time algorithm based on fast \\nmatrix multiplication. Sankowski [394] and Yuster and Zwick [465] designed an \\nalgorithm for shortest paths that runs in e O.WV ! / time, where two n \\ue005 n matri- \\nces can be multiplied in O.n ! / time, giving a faster algorithm than the previously \\nmentioned algorithms for small values of W on dense graphs. \\nCherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik [89] conducted extensive experiments com- \\nparing various shortest-path algorithms.

A classic application of this problem occurs in computing a \\ntable of distances between all pairs of cities for a road atlas. Classic perhaps, but \\nnot a true application of ûnding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. After \\nall, a road map modeled as a graph has one vertex f or every road intersection and \\none edge wherever a road connects intersections. A table of intercity distances in an \\natlas might include distances for 100 cities, but the United States has approximately \\n300,000 signal-controlled intersections 1 and many more uncontrolled intersections. \\nA legitimate application of all-pairs shortest paths is to determine the diameter \\nof a network: the longest of all shortest paths. If  a directed graph models a com- \\nmunication network, with the weight of an edge indi cating the time required for \\na message to traverse a communication link, then th e diameter gives the longest \\npossible transit time for a message in the network. \\nAs in Chapter 22, the input is a weighted, directed  graph G D .V;E/ with a \\nweight function w W E ! R that maps edges to real-valued weights. Now the goal \\nis to ûnd, for every pair of vertices u;v 2 V , a shortest (least-weight) path from u \\nto v, where the weight of a path is the sum of the weig hts of its constituent edges. \\nFor the all-pairs problem, the output typically takes a tabular form in which the \\nentry in u9s row and v9s column is the weight of a shortest path from u to v. \\nYou can solve an all-pairs shortest-paths problem by running a single-source \\nshortest-paths algorithm jV j times, once with each vertex as the source.

The \\nresulting running time is O.V 2 E/, which on a dense graph is O.V 4 /. This chapter \\nshows how to guarantee a much better asymptotic running time. It also investigates \\nthe relation of the all-pairs shortest-paths problem to matrix multiplication. \\nUnlike the single-source algorithms, which assume an adjacency-list representa- \\ntion of the graph, most of the algorithms in this c hapter represent the graph by \\nan adjacency matrix. (Johnson9s algorithm for sparse graphs, in Section 23.3, \\nuses adjacency lists.)

Imagine a mate- \\nrial coursing through a system from a source, where  the material is produced, to \\na sink, where it is consumed. The source produces t he material at some steady \\nrate, and the sink consumes the material at the same rate. The <üow= of the mate- \\nrial at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves. \\nFlow networks can model many problems, including liquids üowing through pipes, \\nparts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, and information \\nthrough communication networks. \\nYou can think of each directed edge in a üow network as a conduit for the mate- \\nrial. Each conduit has a stated capacity, given as a maximum rate at which the ma- \\nterial can üow through the conduit, such as 200 gallons of liquid per hour through \\na pipe or 20 amperes of electrical current through a wire. Verti ces are conduit \\njunctions, and other than the source and sink, material üows through the vertices \\nwithout collecting in them. In other words, the rate at which material enters a ver- \\ntex must equal the rate at which it leaves the vert ex.

We call it a <method= rather than an <algorithm= because it encompasses \\nseveral implementations with differing running times. The Ford-Fulkerson method \\ndepends on three important ideas that transcend the  method and are relevant to \\nmany üow algorithms and problems: residual networks, augmenting paths, and \\ncuts. These ideas are essential to the important max-üow min-cut theorem (The- \\norem 24.6), which characterizes the value of a maximum üow in terms of cuts of \\nthe üow network. We end this section by presenting one speciûc implementation \\nof the Ford-Fulkerson method and analyzing its running time. \\nThe Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively increases the value of the üow. It starts \\nwith f .u; v/ D 0 for all u; v 2 V , giving an initial üow of value 0. Each iteration \\nincreases the üow value in G by ûnding an <augmenting path= in an associated \\n<residual network= G f . The edges of the augmenting path in G f indicate on which \\nedges in G to update the üow in order to increase the üow value. Although each \\niteration of the Ford-Fulkerson method increases the value of the üow, we9ll see \\nthat the üow on any particular edge of G may increase or decrease. Although it \\nmight seem counterintuitive to decrease the üow on an edge, doing so may enable \\nüow to increase on other edges, allowing more üow to travel from the source to \\nthe sink. The Ford-Fulkerson method, given in the procedure FORD-FULKERSON - \\nMETHOD, repeatedly augments the üow until the residual network has no more \\naugmenting paths. The max-üow min-cut theorem shows that upon termination, \\nthis process yields a maximum üow. \\nFORD-FULKERSON -METHOD .G; s; t/  \\n1 initialize üow f to 0 \\n2 while there exists an augmenting path p in the residual network G f \\n3 augment üow f along p \\n4 return f '),\n",

An \\nedge of the üow network can admit an amount of additional üow equal to the \\nedge9s capacity minus the üow on that edge. If that value is positive, that edge \\ngoes into G f with a <residual capacity= of c f .u; v/ D c.u; v/  \\ue003 f .u; v/. The \\nonly edges of G that belong to G f are those that can admit more üow. Those \\nedges .u; v/ whose üow equals their capacity have c f .u; v/ D 0, and they do not \\nbelong to G f . \\nYou might be surprised that the residual network G f can also contain edges that \\nare not in G. As an algorithm manipulates the üow, with the goal of increasing \\nthe total üow, it might need to decrease the üow on a particular edge in order to \\nincrease the üow elsewhere. In order to represent a possible decrease in the positive \\nüow f .u; v/ on an edge in G, the residual network G f contains an edge .v; u/ with \\nresidual capacity c f .v; u/ D f .u; v/4that is, an edge that can admit üow in the \\nopposite direction to .u; v/, at most canceling out the üow on .u; v/. These reverse \\nedges in the residual network allow an algorithm to  send back üow it has already \\nsent along an edge. Sending üow back along an edge is equivalent to decreasing \\nthe üow on the edge, which is a necessary operation in many algorithms. \\nMore formally, for a üow network G D .V; E/  with source s , sink t , and a \\nüow f , consider a pair of vertices u; v 2 V . We deûne the \\nresidual capac- \\nity c f .u; v/ by \\nc f .u; v/ D \\nĨ \\nc.u; v/  \\ue003 f .u; v/ if .u; v/ 2 E ;  \\nf .v; u/ if .v; u/ 2 E ;  \\n0 otherwise : \\n(24.2) \\nIn a üow network, .u; v/ 2 E implies .v; u/ … E, and so exactly one case in \\nequation (24.2) applies to each ordered pair of vertices. \\nAs an example of equation (24.2), if c.u; v/  D 16 and f .u; v/ D 11, then \\nf .u; v/ can increase by up to c f .u; v/ D 5 units before exceeding the capacity \\nconstraint on edge .u; v/. Alternatively, up to 11 units of üow can return from v \\nto u, so that c f .v; u/ D 11. \\nGiven a üow network G D .V; E/  and a üow f , the residual network of G \\ninduced by f is G f D .V; E f /, where \\nE f D f.u; v/ 2 V \\ue005 V W c f .u; v/ > 0 g : (24.3) '),\n",

The max-üow min-cut theorem, \\nwhich we will prove shortly, tells us that a üow is maximum if and only if its \\nresidual network contains no augmenting path. To prove this theorem, though, we \\nmust ûrst explore the notion of a cut of a üow network. \\nA cut .S;T/  of üow network G D .V;E/ is a partition of V into S and \\nT D V \\ue003 S such that s 2 S and t 2 T .

This section presents \\none such problem: ûnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. In order to \\nsolve this problem, we’ll take advantage of an integrality property provided by the \\nFord-Fulkerson method. We’ll also see how to use the Ford-Fulkerson method to \\nsolve the maximum-bipartite-matching problem on a graph G D .V;E/ in O.VE/ \\ntime. Section 25.1 will present an algorithm speciûcally designed to solve this \\nproblem. \\nThe maximum-bipartite-matching problem \\nGiven an undirected graph G D .V;E/, a \\nmatching is a subset of edges M ෂ E \\nsuch that for all vertices v 2 V , at most one edge of M is incident on v. We say \\nthat a vertex v 2 V is matched by the matching M if some edge in M is incident \\non v, and otherwise, v is unmatched. A maximum matching is a matching of \\nmaximum cardinality, that is, a matching M such that for any matching M 0 , we \\nhave jM j \\ue004 jM 0 j. In this section, we restrict our attention to ûnding maximum \\nmatchings in bipartite graphs: graphs in which the vertex set can be partitioned \\ninto V D L [ R, where L and R are disjoint and all edges in E go between L \\nand R. We further assume that every vertex in V has at least one incident edge. \\nFigure 24.8 illustrates the notion of a matching in a bipartite graph. \\nThe problem of ûnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph has many \\npractical applications.

We say that a üow f on a üow network \\nG D .V;E/ is integer-valued if f.u;v/ is an integer for all .u;v/ 2 V \\ue005 V . \\nLemma 24.9 \\nLet G D .V;E/ be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V D L [ R, and let \\nG 0 D .V 0 ;E 0 / be its corresponding üow network. If M is a matching in G, then \\nthere is an integer-valued üow f in G 0 with value jf j D j M j. Conversely, if f \\nis an integer-valued üow in G 0 , then there is a matching M in G with cardinality \\njM j D jf j consisting of edges .u;v/ 2 E such that f.u;v/>0 . \\nProof We ûrst show that a matching M in G corresponds to an integer-valued \\nüow f in G 0 . Deûne f as follows. If .u;v/ 2 M , then f.s;u/ D f.u;v/ D \\nf.v;t/  D 1. For all other edges .u;v/ 2 E 0 , deûne f.u;v/ D 0. It is simple to \\nverify that f satisûes the capacity constraint and üow conservation. \\nIntuitively, each edge .u;v/ 2 M corresponds to 1 unit of üow in G 0 that tra- \\nverses the path s ! u ! v ! t . Moreover, the paths induced by edges in M are \\nvertex-disjoint, except for s and t . The net üow across cut .L [ fs g ;R [ ft g/ is \\nequal to jM j, and thus, by Lemma 24.4, the value of the üow is jf j D jM j. \\nTo prove the converse, let f be an integer-valued üow in G 0 and, as in the state- \\nment of the lemma, let \\nM D f.u;v/ W u 2 L;v 2 R; and f.u;v/>0 g : \\nEach vertex u 2 L has only one entering edge, namely .s;u/, and its capacity \\nis 1. Thus, each u 2 L has at most 1 unit of üow entering it, and if 1 unit of üow \\ndoes enter, by üow conservation, 1 unit of üow must leave. Furthermore, since the \\nüow f is integer-valued, for each u 2 L, the 1 unit of üow can enter on at most \\none edge and can leave on at most one edge. Thus, 1 unit of üow enters u if and \\nonly if there is exactly one vertex v 2 R such that f.u;v/ D 1, and at most one \\nedge leaving each u 2 L carries positive üow. A symmetric argument applies to \\neach v 2 R. The set M is therefore a matching. \\nTo see that jM j D j f j, observe that of the edges .u;v/ 2 E 0 such that u 2 L \\nand v 2 R, \\nf.u;v/ D \\n( \\n1 if .u;v/ 2 M ; \\n0 if .u;v/ … M : \\nConsequently, f.L [ fs g ;R [ ft g/, the net üow across cut .L [ fs g ;R [ ft g/, is \\nequal to jM j.

The only hitch in this reasoning is that the maximum- \\nüow algorithm might return a üow in G 0 for which some f.u;v/ is not an integer, \\neven though the üow value jf j must be an integer. The following theorem shows \\nthat the Ford-Fulkerson method cannot produce a solution with this problem. \\nTheorem 24.10 (Integrality theorem) \\nIf the capacity function c takes on only integer values, then the maximum üow f \\nproduced by the Ford-Fulkerson method has the property that jf j is an integer. \\nMoreover, for all vertices u and v, the value of f.u;v/ is an integer. \\nProof Exercise 24.3-2 asks you to provide the proof by induction on the number \\nof iterations. \\nWe can now prove the following corollary to Lemma 24.9. \\nCorollary 24.11 \\nThe cardinality of a maximum matching M in a bipartite graph G equals the value \\nof a maximum üow f in its corresponding üow network G 0 . \\nProof We use the nomenclature from Lemma 24.9. Suppose that M is a max- \\nimum matching in G and that the corresponding üow f in G 0 is not maximum. \\nThen there is a maximum üow f 0 in G 0 such that jf 0 j > jf j. Since the ca- \\npacities in G 0 are integer-valued, by Theorem 24.10, we can assume that f 0 is \\ninteger-valued. Thus, f 0 corresponds to a matching M 0 in G with cardinality \\njM 0 j D j f 0 j > jf j D j M j, contradicting our assumption that M is a maximum \\nmatching. In a similar manner, we can show that if f is a maximum üow in G 0 , its \\ncorresponding matching is a maximum matching on G. \\nThus, to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite undirected graph G, create the \\nüow network G 0 , run the Ford-Fulkerson method on G 0 , and convert the integer- \\nvalued maximum üow found into a maximum matching for G. Since any matching \\nin a bipartite graph has cardinality at most min fjLj ; jRjg D O.V/, the value of \\nthe maximum üow in G 0 is O.V/. Therefore, ûnding a maximum matching in a \\nbipartite graph takes O.VE 0 / D O.VE/ time, since jE 0 j D ‚.E/. \\nExercises \\n24.3-1 \\nRun the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on the üow network in Figure 24.8(c) and show \\nthe residual network after each üow augmentation.

This deûnition is like the deûnition of cut that \\nwe have used in this chapter, except that we no longer have distinguished vertices \\ns and t . Any edge .u;v/ with u 2 V 1 and v 2 V 2 is said to cross the cut. \\nWe can extend this deûnition of a cut to a multigraph G D .V;E/ (see \\npage 1167), and we denote by c.u;v/ the number of edges in the multigraph with \\nendpoints u and v.

It uses the notion \\nof an edge contraction, deûned on page 1168, with one crucial difference. The \\nalgorithm maintains a multigraph, so that upon contracting an edge .u;v/, it creates \\na new vertex x , and for any other vertex y 2 V , the number of edges between x \\nand y is c.u;y/ C c.v;y/. The algorithm does not maintain self-loops, and so it \\nsets c.x;x/ to 0.

Push-relabel algorithms allow üow conservation to be violated at vertices \\nother than the source and sink as they execute. Using an idea ûrst developed by \\nKarzonov [251], they allow a \\npreüow in which the üow into a vertex may exceed \\nthe üow out of the vertex. Such a vertex is said to be overüowing. Initially, every \\nedge leaving the source is ûlled to capacity, so that all neighbors of the source \\nare overüowing. In a push-relabel algorithm, each vertex is assigned an integer \\nheight. An overüowing vertex may push üow to a neighboring vertex to which it \\nhas a residual edge provided that it is higher than the neighbor. If all residual edges \\nfrom an overüowing vertex go to neighbors with equal or greater heights, then the \\nvertex may increase its height. Once all vertices other than the sink are no longer \\noverüowing, the preüow is not only a legal üow, but also a maximum üow. \\nGoldberg and Tarjan [188] gave an O.V 3 /-time algorithm that uses a queue to \\nmaintain the set of overüowing vertices, as well as an algorithm that uses dynamic \\ntrees to achieve a running time of O.VE lg.V 2 =E C 2//. Several other researchers \\ndeveloped improved variants and implementations [9, 10, 15, 86, 87, 255, 358], \\nthe fastest of which, by King, Rao, and Tarjan [255], runs in O.VE log E=.V lg V / V/ \\ntime. \\nAnother efûcient algorithm for maximum üow, by Goldberg and Rao [187], runs \\nin O \\nã \\nmin \\n˚ \\nV 2=3 ;E 1=2 \\ue009 \\nE lg.V 2 =E C 2/ lg C \\nä \\ntime, where C is the maximum ca- \\npacity of any edge. Orlin [350] gave an algorithm in the same spirit as this algo- \\nrithm that runs in O.VE C E 31=16 lg 2 V/ time. Combining it with the algorithm of \\nKing, Rao, and Tarjan results in an O.VE/-time algorithm. \\nA different approach to maximum üows and related problems is to use tech- \\nniques from continuous optimization including elect rical üows and interior-point \\nmethods. The ûrst breakthrough in this line of work is due to Madry [308], who \\ngave an e O.E 10=7 /-time algorithm for unit-capacity maximum üow and bipartite \\nmaximum matching. (See Problem 3-6 on page 73 for a deûnition of e O .) There has \\nbeen a series of papers in this area for matchings, maximum üows, and minimum- \\ncost üows. The fastest algorithm to date in this line of work for maximum üow is \\ndue to Lee and Sidford [285], taking e O. \\np \\nVE lg O.1/ C/ time. If the capacities are \\nnot too large, this algorithm is faster than the O.VE/-time algorithm mentioned \\nabove. Another algorithm, due to Liu and Sidford [303] runs in e O.E 11=8 C 1=4 / \\ntime, where C is the maximum capacity of any edge. This algorithm does not run \\nin polynomial time, but for small enough capacities , it is faster than the previous \\nones. \\nIn practice, push-relabel algorithms currently dominate algorithms based on aug- \\nmenting paths, continuous-optimization, and linear programming for the maxi- \\nmum-üow problem [88] .

For an undirected graph G D .V;E/, a matching is a subset of edges \\nM ෂ E such that every vertex in V has at most one incident edge in M . \\nFor example, consider the following scenario. You h ave one or more positions \\nto ûll and several candidates to interview. According to your schedule, you are \\nable to interview candidates at certain time slots.  You ask t he candidates to indi- \\ncate the subsets of time slots at which they are av ailable. How can you schedule \\nthe interviews so that each time slot has at most o ne candidate scheduled, while \\nmaximizing the number of candidates that you can interview? You can model this \\nscenario as a matching problem on a bipartite graph  in which e ach vertex repre- \\nsents either a candidate or a time slot, with an edge between a candidate and a time \\nslot if the candidate is available then. If an edge  is included in the matching, that \\nmeans you are scheduling a particular candidate for  a particular time slot. Your \\ngoal is to ûnd a maximum matching: a matching of maximum cardinality. One of \\nthe authors of this book was faced with exactly this situation when hiring teaching \\nassistants for a large class. He used the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm in Section 25.1 \\nto schedule the interviews. \\nAnother application of matching is the U.S. Nationa l Resident Matching Pro- \\ngram, in which medical students are matched to hosp itals where they will be sta- \\ntioned as medical residents. Each student ranks the  hospitals by preference, and \\neach hospital ranks the students. The goal is to as sign students to hospitals so that \\nthere is never a student and a hospital that both have regrets because the student was \\nnot assigned to the hospital, yet each ranked the o ther higher than who or where \\nthey were assigned. This scenario is perhaps the best-known real-world example \\nof the <stable-marriage problem,= which Section 25.2 examines. \\nYet another instance where matching comes into play occurs when workers must \\nbe assigned to tasks in order to maximize the overa ll effectiveness of the assign- \\nment. For each worker and each task, the worker has some quantiûed effectiveness '),\n",

Assuming that there are equal numbers of workers and tasks, the goal \\nis to ûnd a matching with the maximum total effectiveness. Such a situation is an \\nexample of an assignment problem, which Section 25.3 shows how to solve. \\nThe algorithms in this chapter ûnd matchings in bipartite graphs. As in Sec- \\ntion 24.3, the input is an undirected graph G D .V;E/, where V D L [ R, the \\nvertex sets L and R are disjoint, and every edge in E is incident on one vertex in L \\nand one vertex in R. A matching, therefore, matches vertices in L with vertices \\nin R. In some applications, the sets L and R have equal cardinality, and in other \\napplications they need not be the same size. \\nAn undirected graph need not be bipartite for the c oncept of m atching to ap- \\nply. Matching in general undirected graphs has appl ications in areas such as \\nscheduling and computational chemistry. It models p roblems in which you want \\nto pair up entities, represented by vertices. Two v ertices are adjacent if they rep- \\nresent compatible entities, and you need to ûnd a large set of compatible pairs. \\nMaximum-matching and maximum-weight matching problems on general graphs \\ncan be solved by polynomial-time algorithms whose running times are similar to \\nthose for bipartite matching, but the algorithms are signiûcantly more compli- \\ncated. Exercise 25.2-5 discusses the general version of the stable-marriage prob- \\nlem, known as the <stable-roommates problem.= Although matching applies to \\ngeneral undirected graphs, this chapter deals only with bipartite graphs. \\n25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) \\nSection 24.3 demonstrated one way to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite \\ngraph, by ûnding a maximum üow. This section provides a more efûcient method, \\nthe Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which runs in O. \\np \\nVE/ time. Figure 25.1(a) shows \\na matching in an undirected bipartite graph. A vert ex that has an incident edge in \\nmatching M is matched under M , and otherwise, it is unmatched. A maximal \\nmatching is a matching M to which no other edges can be added, that is, for every \\nedge e 2 E \\ue003 M , the edge set M [ feg fails to be a matching. A maximum \\nmatching is always maximal, but the reverse does not always hold. \\nMany algorithms to ûnd maximum matchings, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm in- \\ncluded, work by incrementally increasing the size o f a matching. Given a match- \\ning M in an undirected graph G D .V;E/, an M -alternating path is a simple path \\nwhose edges alternate between being in M and being in E \\ue003 M . Figure 25.1(b) de- \\npicts an M -augmenting path (sometimes called an augmenting path with respect \\nto M ): an M -alternating path whose ûrst and last edges belong to E \\ue003 M . Since an \\nM -augmenting path contains one more edge in E \\ue003 M than in M , it must consist \\nof an odd number of edges. '),\n",

Since a matching is a set of \\nedges, the lemma relies on the notion of the symmetric difference of two sets: \\nX ˚ Y D .X \\ue003 Y/ [ .Y \\ue003 X/, that is, the elements that belong to X or Y , but not \\nboth. Alternatively, you can think of X ˚Y as .X [Y/\\ue003.X \\\\Y/. The operator ˚ is \\ncommutative and associative.

Since \\nE 0 D M ˚ M \\ue003 \\nD .M [ M \\ue003 / \\ue003 .M \\\\ M \\ue003 / \\nand jM \\ue003 j > jM j, the edge set E 0 must contain jM \\ue003 j \\ue003 jM j more edges from M \\ue003 \\nthan from M . Because each cycle in G 0 has an even number of edges drawn al- \\nternately from M and M \\ue003 , each cycle has an equal number of edges from M \\nand M \\ue003 . Therefore, the simple paths in G 0 account for there being jM \\ue003 j \\ue003 jM j \\nmore edges from M \\ue003 than M . Each path containing a different number of edges \\nfrom M and M \\ue003 either starts and ends with edges from M , containing one more \\nedge from M than from M \\ue003 , or starts and ends with edges from M \\ue003 , containing \\none more edge from M \\ue003 than from M . Because E 0 contains jM \\ue003 j \\ue003 jM j more \\nedges from M \\ue003 than from M , there are at least jM \\ue003 j \\ue003 jM j paths of the latter \\ntype, and each one is an M -augmenting path. Because each vertex has at most two \\nincident edges from E 0 , these paths must be vertex-disjoint. \\nIf an algorithm ûnds a maximum matching by incrementally increasing the size \\nof the matching, how does it determine when to stop? The following corollary \\ngives the answer: when there are no augmenting paths. \\nCorollary 25.4 \\nMatching M in graph G D .V;E/ is a maximum matching if and only if G con- \\ntains no M -augmenting path. \\nProof We prove the contrapositive of both directions of t he lemma statement. \\nThe contrapositive of the forward direction is stra ightforward.

(In the BFS \\nprocedure on page 556, replace the root vertex s by the set of unmatched vertices \\nin L.) The predecessor attributes � computed by the BFS procedure are not needed \\nhere, since H is a dag and not necessarily a tree. \\nEvery path in H from a vertex in layer 0 to an unmatched vertex in layer q \\ncorresponds to a shortest M -augmenting path in the original bipartite graph G. Just \\nuse the undirected versions of the directed edges i n H . Moreover, every shortest \\nM -augmenting path in G is present in H . \\nThe third phase identiûes a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augment- \\ning paths. As Figure 25.3 shows, it starts by creating the transpose H T of H . Then, \\nfor each unmatched vertex r in layer q, it performs a depth-ûrst search starting \\nfrom r until it either reaches a vertex in layer 0 or has exhausted all possible paths \\nwithout reaching a vertex in layer 0. Instead of maintaining discovery and ûnish \\ntimes, the depth-ûrst search just needs to keep track of the predecessor attributes � \\nin the depth-ûrst tree of each search. Upon reaching a vertex in layer 0, tracing back \\nalong the predecessors identiûes an M -augmenting path. Each vertex is searched \\nfrom only when it is ûrst discovered in any search. If the search from a vertex r \\nin layer q cannot ûnd a path of undiscovered vertices to an undiscovered vertex in \\nlayer 0, then no M -augmenting path including r goes into the maximal set. \\nFigure 25.3 shows the result of the third phase. The ûrst depth-ûrst search starts \\nfrom vertex r 1 . It identiûes the M -augmenting path h.r 1 ;l 3 /;.l 3 ;r 3 /;.r 3 ;l 1 /i, \\nwhich is highlighted in orange, and discovers verti ces r 1 , l 3 , r 3 , and l 1 .

Then, \\nP contains edges that are in M but are not in any of P 1 ;P 2 ;:::;P  k , so that P is \\nalso an M -augmenting path. Since P is disjoint from P 1 ;P 2 ;:::;P  k but is also \\nan M -augmenting path, and since P is a maximal set of shortest M -augmenting \\npaths, P must be longer than any of the augmenting paths in P , each of which has \\nlength q. Therefore, P has more than q edges. \\nNow, assume that P visits at least one vertex from the M -augmenting paths \\nin P . By Corollary 25.2, M 0 is a matching in G with jM 0 j D jM j C k. Since P is \\nan M 0 -augmenting path, by Lemma 25.1, M 0 ˚ P is a matching with jM 0 ˚ P j D \\njM 0 j C 1 D j M j C k C 1. Now let A D M ˚ M 0 ˚ P .

If you know that the graph G D .V;E/ with vertex partition V D L [ R is \\na complete bipartite graph 1 4containing an edge from every vertex in L to every \\nvertex in R4then you can ûnd a maximum matching by a simple greedy algorithm. \\nWhen a graph can have several matchings, you might want to decide which \\nmatchings are most desirable. In Section 25.3, we’ll add weights to the edges and \\nûnd a matching of maximum weight. In this section, we will instead add some \\ninformation to each vertex in a complete bipartite graph: a ranking of the vertices \\nin the other side. That is, each vertex in L has an ordered list of all the vertices in R, \\nand vice-versa. To keep things simple, let’s assume that L and R each contain n \\nvertices. The goal here is to match each vertex in L with a vertex in R in a <stable= \\nway. \\nThis problem derives its name, the stable-marriage problem, from the notion of \\nheterosexual marriage, viewing L as a set of women and R as a set of men. 2 Each \\nwoman ranks all the men in terms of desirability, and each man does the same with \\nall the women. The goal is to pair up women and men  (a matching) so that if a \\nwoman and a man are not matched to each other, then at least one of them prefers \\ntheir assigned partner. \\nIf a woman and a man are not matched to each other but each prefers the other \\nover their assigned partner, they form a blocking pair. A blocking pair has incen- \\ntive to opt out of the assigned pairing and get tog ether on their own. If that were \\nto occur, then this pair would block the matching f rom being <stable.= A stable \\n1 The deûnition of a complete bipartite graph differs from the deûnition of complete graph given \\non page 1167 because in a bipartite graph, there are no edges between vertices in L and no edges \\nbetween vertices in R. \\n2 Although marriage norms are changing, it’s traditional to view the stable-marriage problem through \\nthe lens of heterosexual marriage.

If there is a blocking \\npair, then the matching is unstable. \\nLet’s look at an example with four women4Wanda, Emma, Lacey, and Karen4 \\nand four men4Oscar, Davis, Brent, and Hank4having the following preferences: \\nWanda: Brent, Hank, Oscar, Davis \\nEmma: Davis, Hank, Oscar, Brent \\nLacey: Brent, Davis, Hank, Oscar \\nKaren: Brent, Hank, Davis, Oscar \\nOscar: Wanda, Karen, Lacey, Emma \\nDavis: Wanda, Lacey, Karen, Emma \\nBrent: Lacey, Karen, Wanda, Emma \\nHank: Lacey, Wanda, Emma, Karen \\nA stable matching comprises the following pairs: \\nLacey and Brent \\nWanda and Hank \\nKaren and Davis \\nEmma and Oscar \\nYou can verify that this matching has no blocking pair. For example, even though \\nKaren prefers Brent and Hank to her partner Davis, Brent prefers his partner Lacey \\nto Karen, and Hank prefers his partner Wanda to Karen, so that neither Karen and \\nBrent nor Karen and Hank form a blocking pair.

(Ex- \\nercise 25.2-3 asks you to show that even in the scenario of the National Resident \\nMatching Program, where each hospital takes on mult iple students, it is always \\npossible to devise a stable assignment.) A simple a lgorithm known as the Gale- \\nShapley algorithm always ûnds a stable matching. The algorithm has two variants, \\nwhich mirror each other: <woman-oriented= and <man-oriented.= Let’s examine \\nthe woman-oriented version. Each participant is either <free= or <engaged.= Ev- \\neryone starts out free. Engagements occur when a fr ee woman proposes to a man. \\nWhen a man is ûrst proposed to, he goes from free to engaged, and he always stays \\nengaged, though not necessarily to the same woman. If an engaged man receives \\na proposal from a woman whom he prefers to the woman he’s currently engaged \\nto, that engagement is broken, the woman to whom he had been engaged becomes \\nfree, and the man and the woman whom he prefers become engaged. Each woman \\nproposes to the men in her preference list, in order, until the last time she becomes \\nengaged. When a woman is engaged, she temporarily s tops proposing, but if she \\nbecomes free again, she continues down her list. Once everyone is engaged, the \\nalgorithm terminates. The procedure GALE -SHAPLEY on the next page makes this \\nprocess more concrete. The procedure allows for som e choice: any free woman \\nmay be selected in line 2. We’ll see that the procedure produces a stable matching \\nregardless of the order in which line 2 chooses fre e women.

The proof is by cont radiction. If the loop fails to \\nterminate, it is because some woman remains free. In order for a woman to remain \\nfree, she must have proposed to all the men and bee n rejected by each one. In \\norder for a man to reject a woman, he must be alrea dy engaged. Therefore, all \\nthe men are engaged. Once engaged, a man stays engaged (though not necessarily \\nto the same woman). There are an equal number n of women and men, however, \\nwhich means that every woman is engaged, leading to  the contradiction that no \\nwomen are free. We must also show that the while loop makes a bounded number \\nof iterations. Since each of the n women goes through her ranking of the n men in \\norder, possibly not reaching the end of her list, t he total number of iterations is at \\nmost n 2 . Therefore, the while loop always terminates, and the procedure returns a \\nmatching. \\nWe need to show that there are no blocking pairs. We ûrst observe that once a \\nman m is engaged to a woman w, all subsequent actions for m occur in lines 638. \\nTherefore, once a man is engaged, he stays engaged,  and any time he breaks an \\nengagement to a woman w, it’s for a woman whom he prefers to w. Suppose that \\na woman w is matched with a man m, but she prefers man m 0 . We’ll show that w \\nand m 0 is not a blocking pair, because m 0 does not prefer w to his partner. Because \\nw ranks m 0 higher than m, she must have proposed to m 0 before proposing to m, \\nand m 0 either rejected her proposal or accepted it and later broke the engagement. \\nIf m 0 rejected the proposal from w, it is because he was already engaged to some \\nwoman he prefers to w. If m 0 accepted and later broke the engagement, he was at \\nsome point engaged to w but later accepted a proposal from a woman he prefe rs \\nto w. In either case, he ultimately ends up with a part ner whom he prefers to w. \\nWe conclude that even though w might prefer m 0 to her partner m, it is not also the \\ncase that m 0 prefers w to his partner. Therefore, the procedure returns a matching \\ncontaining no blocking pairs. \\nExercise 25.2-1 asks you to provide the proof of the following corollary. \\nCorollary 25.10 \\nGiven preference rankings for n women and n men, the Gale-Shapley algorithm \\ncan be implemented to run in O.n 2 / time. \\nBecause line 2 can choose any free woman, you might wonder whether different \\nchoices can produce different stable matchings.

Moreover, the stable matching returned is optimal for the women. \\nTheorem 25.11 \\nRegardless of how women are chosen in line 2 of GALE -SHAPLEY , the procedure \\nalways returns the same stable matching, and in this stable matching, each woman \\nhas the best partner possible in any stable matching. \\nProof The proof that each woman has the best partner poss ible in any stable \\nmatching is by contradiction. Suppose that the GALE -SHAPLEY procedure returns \\na stable matching M , but that there is a different stable matching M 0 in which some \\nwoman w prefers her partner m 0 to the partner m she has in M . Because w ranks \\nm 0 higher than m, she must have proposed to m 0 before proposing to m. Then there \\nis a woman w 0 whom m 0 prefers to w, and m 0 was already engaged to w 0 when w \\nproposed or m 0 accepted the proposal from w and later broke the engagement in \\nfavor of w 0 . Either way, there is a moment when m 0 decided against w in favor \\nof w 0 . Now suppose, without loss of generality, that this moment was the ûrst time \\nthat any man rejected a partner who belongs to some stable matching. \\nWe claim that w 0 cannot have a partner m 00 in a stable matching whom she prefers \\nto m 0 . If there were such a man m 00 , then in order for w 0 to propose to m 0 , she would \\nhave proposed to m 00 and been rejected at some point before proposing to m 0 . If m 0 \\naccepted the proposal from w and later broke it to accept w 0 , then since this was \\nthe ûrst rejection in a stable matching, we get the contradiction that m 00 could not \\nhave rejected w 0 beforehand. If m 0 was already engaged to w 0 when w proposed, \\nthen again, m 00 could not have rejected w 0 beforehand, thus proving the claim. \\nSince w 0 does not prefer anyone to m 0 in a stable matching and w 0 is not matched \\nwith m 0 in M 0 (because m 0 is matched with w in M 0 ), w 0 prefers m 0 to her partner \\nin M 0 . Since w 0 prefers m 0 over her partner in M 0 and m 0 prefers w 0 over his \\npartner w in M 0 , the pair w 0 and m 0 is a blocking pair in M 0 . Because M 0 has a \\nblocking pair, it cannot be a stable matching, thereby contradicting the assumption \\nthat there exists some stable matching in which eac h woman has the best partner \\npossible other than the matching M returned by GALE -SHAPLEY . \\nWe put no condition on the execution of the procedu re, which means that all \\npossible orders in which line 2 selects women resul t in the same stable matching \\nbeing returned. \\nCorollary 25.12 \\nThere can be stable matchings that the GALE -SHAPLEY procedure does not return. \\nProof Theorem 25.11 says that for a given set of rankings, GALE -SHAPLEY re- \\nturns just one matching, no matter how it chooses women in line 2.

Any exhaustive graph-search method sufûces. Here, we’ll \\nuse breadth-ûrst search, starting from all the unmatched vertices in L (just as the \\nHopcroft-Karp algorithm does when creating the dag H ), but stopping upon ûrst \\ndiscovering some unmatched vertex in R. Figure 25.5 shows the idea. To start \\nfrom all the unmatched vertices in L, initialize the ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue with all \\nthe unmatched vertices in L, rather than just one source vertex. Unlike the da g H \\nin the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, here each vertex needs just one predecessor, so \\nthat the breadth-ûrst search creates a breadth-ûrst forest F D .V F ;E F /. Each \\nunmatched vertex in L is a root in F . \\nIn Figure 25.5(g), the breadth-ûrst search has found the M -augmenting path \\nh.l 4 ;r 2 /;.r 2 ;l 1 /;.l 1 ;r 3 /;.r 3 ;l 6 /;.l 6 ;r 5 /i. Figure 25.6(a) shows the new matching \\ncreated by taking the symmetric difference of the m atching M in Figure 25.5(a) \\nwith this M -augmenting path. \\nWhen the search for an M -augmenting path fails \\nHaving updated the matching M from an M -augmenting path, the Hungarian algo- \\nrithm updates the directed equality subgraph G M;h according to the new matching \\nand then starts a new breadth-ûrst search from all the unmatched vertices in L. \\nFigure 25.6 shows the start of this process, picking up from Figure 25.5. \\nIn Figure 25.6(d), the queue contains vertices l 4 and l 3 . Neither of these vertices \\nhas an edge that leaves it, however, so that once t hese vertices are removed from \\nthe queue, the queue becomes empty. The search term inates at this point, before \\ndiscovering an unmatched vertex in R to yield an M -augmenting path. When- \\never this situation occurs, the most recently discovered vertices must belong to L. \\nWhy? Whenever an unmatched vertex in R is discovered, the search has found \\nan M -augmenting path, and when a matched vertex in R is discovered, it has an \\nunvisited neighbor in L, which the search can then discover. \\nRecall that we have the freedom to work with any eq uality subgraph. We can \\nchange the directed equality subgraph <on the üy,= as long we do not counteract the \\nwork already done. The Hungarian algorithm updates the feasible vertex labeling h \\nto fulûll the following criteria: \\n1. No edge in the breadth-ûrst forest F leaves the directed equality subgraph. \\n2. No edge in the matching M leaves the directed equality subgraph. \\n3. At least one edge .l;r/, where l 2 L \\\\ V F and r 2 R \\ue003 V F goes into E h , and \\nhence into E M;h . Therefore, at least one vertex in R will be newly discovered. \\nThus, at least one new edge enters the directed equ ality subgraph, and any edge \\nthat leaves the directed equality subgraph belongs to neither the matching M nor '),\n",

Then, the labeling h 0 in \\nequation (25.5) is a feasible vertex labeling for G with the following properties: \\n1. If .u;v/ is an edge in the breadth-ûrst forest F for G M;h , then .u;v/ 2 E M;h 0 . \\n2. If .l;r/ belongs to the matching M for G h , then .r;l/ 2 E M;h 0 . \\n3. There exist vertices l 2 F L and r 2 R \\ue003 F R such that .l;r/ … E M;h but \\n.l;r/ 2 E M;h 0 . \\nProof We ûrst show that h 0 is a feasible vertex labeling for G. Because h is a \\nfeasible vertex labeling, we have l: h C r: h \\ue004 w.l;r/ for all l 2 L and r 2 R. \\nIn order for h 0 to not be a feasible vertex labeling, we would need  l: h 0 C r: h 0 < \\nl: h C r: h for some l 2 L and r 2 R. The only way this could occur would be \\nfor some l 2 F L and r 2 R \\ue003 F R . In this instance, the amount of the decrease \\nequals ı , so that l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h \\ue003 ı C r: h. By equation (25.4), we have that \\nl: h \\ue003ı Cr: h \\ue004 w.l;r/ for any l 2 F L and r 2 R \\ue003F R , so that l: h 0 Cr: h 0 \\ue004 w.l;r/. \\nFor all other edges, we have l: h 0 C r: h 0 \\ue004 l: h C r: h \\ue004 w.l;r/. Thus, h 0 is a feasible \\nvertex labeling. \\nNow we show that each of the three desired properties holds: \\n1. If l 2 F L and r 2 F R , then we have l: h 0 Cr: h 0 D l: h Cr: h because ı is added to \\nthe label of l and subtracted from the label of r . Therefore, if an edge belongs \\nto F for the directed graph G M;h , it also belongs to G M;h 0 . \\n2. We claim that at the time the Hungarian algorith m computes the new feasible \\nvertex labeling h 0 , for every edge .l;r/ 2 M , we have l 2 F L if and only if \\nr 2 F R . To see why, consider a matched vertex r and let .l;r/ 2 M . First \\nsuppose that r 2 F R , so that the search discovered r and enqueued it. When r \\nwas removed from the queue, l was discovered, so l 2 F L . Now suppose that \\nr … F R , so r is undiscovered. We will show that l … F L . The only edge in G M;h \\nthat enters l is .r;l/, and since r is undiscovered, the search has not taken this \\nedge; if l 2 F L , it is not because of the edge .r;l/. The only other way that \\na vertex in L can be in F L is if it is a root of the search, but only unmatche d \\nvertices in L are roots and l is matched. Thus, l … F L , and the claim is proved. \\nWe already saw that l 2 F L and r 2 F R implies l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h C r: h. For \\nthe opposite case, when l 2 L \\ue003 F L and R 2 R \\ue003 F R , we have that l: h 0 D l: h \\nand r: h 0 D r: h, so that again l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h C r: h. Thus, if edge .l;r/ is in \\nthe matching M for the equality graph G h , then .r;l/ 2 E M;h 0 . '),\n",

Let .l;r/ be an edge not in E h such that l 2 F L , r 2 R \\ue003 F R , and ı D \\nl: h C r: h \\ue003 w.l;r/. By the deûnition of ı , there is at least one such edge.

Since .l;r/ is not in E h , it is not in the matching M , so \\nthat in E M;h 0 it must be directed from L to R. Thus, .l;r/ 2 E M;h 0 . \\nIt is possible for an edge to belong to E M;h but not to E M;h 0 . By Lemma 25.15, \\nany such edge belongs neither to the matching M nor to the breadth-ûrst forest F at \\nthe time that the new feasible vertex labeling h 0 is computed. (See Exercise 25.3-3.) \\nGoing back to Figure 25.6(d), the queue became empty before an M -augmenting \\npath was found. Figure 25.7 shows the next steps taken by the algorithm. The \\nvalue of ı D 1 is achieved by the edge .l 5 ;r 3 / because in Figure 25.4(a), l 5 : h C \\nr 3 : h \\ue003 w.l 5 ;r 3 / D 6 C 0 \\ue003 5 D 1. In Figure 25.7(a), the values of l 3 : h, l 4 : h, \\nl 5 : h, and l 7 : h have decreased by 1 and the values of r 2 : h and r 7 : h have increased \\nby 1 because these vertices are in F . As a result, the edges .l 1 ;r 2 / and .l 6 ;r 7 / \\nleave G M;h and the edge .l 5 ;r 3 / enters. Figure 25.7(b) shows the new directed \\nequality subgraph G M;h . With edge .l 5 ;r 3 / now in G M;h , Figure 25.7(c) shows \\nthat this edge is added to the breadth-ûrst forest F , and r 3 is added to the queue. \\nParts (c)3(f) show the breadth-ûrst forest continuing to be built until in part (f), the \\nqueue once again becomes empty after vertex l 2 , which has no edges leaving, is \\nremoved. Again, the algorithm must update the feasi ble vertex labeling and the \\ndirected equality subgraph. Now the value of ı D 1 is achieved by three edges: \\n.l 1 ;r 6 /, .l 5 ;r 6 /, and .l 7 ;r 6 /. \\nAs Figure 25.8 shows in parts (a) and (b), these edges enter G M;h , and \\nedge .l 6 ;r 3 / leaves. Part (c) shows that edge .l 1 ;r 6 / is added to the breadth- \\nûrst forest. (Either of edges .l 5 ;r 6 / or .l 7 ;r 6 / could have been added in- \\nstead.) Because r 6 is unmatched, the search has found the M -augmenting path \\nh.l 5 ;r 3 /;.r 3 ;l 1 /;.l 1 ;r 6 /i, highlighted in orange. \\nFigure 25.9(a) shows G M;h after the matching M has been updated by tak- \\ning its symmetric difference with the M -augmenting path. The Hungarian al- \\ngorithm starts its last breadth-ûrst search, with vertex l 7 as the only root.

Some chapters introduce new models of computation \\nsuch as circuits or parallel computers. Others cover specialized domains such as \\nmatrices or number theory. The last two chapters di scuss some of the known lim- \\nitations to the design of efûcient algorithms and introduce techniques for coping \\nwith those limitations. \\nChapter 26 presents an algorithmic model for parallel computing based on task- \\nparallel computing, and more speciûcally, fork-join parallelism. The chapter in- \\ntroduces the basics of the model, showing how to qu antify parallelism in terms of \\nthe measures of work and span. It then investigates  several i nteresting fork-join \\nalgorithms, including algorithms for matrix multiplication and merge sorting. \\nAn algorithm that receives its input over time, rather than having the entire input \\navailable at the start, is called an <online= algor ithm. Cha pter 27 examines tech- \\nniques used in online algorithms, starting with the  <toy= problem of how long to \\nwait for an elevator before taking the stairs. It t hen studies the <move-to-front= \\nheuristic for maintaining a linked list and ûnishes with the online version of the \\ncaching problem we saw back in Section 15.4. The analyses of these online al- \\ngorithms are remarkable in that they prove that the se algorithms, which do not \\nknow their future inputs, perform within a constant  factor of optimal algorithms \\nthat know the future inputs. \\nChapter 28 studies efûcient algorithms for operating on matrices. It presents \\ntwo general methods4LU decomposition and LUP decomposition4for solving \\nlinear equations by Gaussian elimination in O.n 3 / time. It also shows that matrix \\ninversion and matrix multiplication can be performe d equally fast. The chapter \\nconcludes by showing how to compute a least-squares approximate solution when \\na set of linear equations has no exact solution. '),\n",

Linear programming arises in a variety  of practical application areas. \\nThe chapter also addresses the concept of <duality=  which, by establishing that a \\nmaximization problem and minimization problem have the same objective value, \\nhelps to show that solutions to each are optimal. \\nChapter 30 studies operations on polynomials and shows how to use a well- \\nknown signal-processing technique4the fast Fourier transform (FFT)4to multi- \\nply two degree-n polynomials in O.n lg n/ time. It also derives a parallel circuit to \\ncompute the FFT. \\nChapter 31 presents number-theoretic algorithms. After reviewing elementary \\nnumber theory, it presents Euclid’s algorithm for computing greatest common di- \\nvisors. Next, it studies algorithms for solving mod ular linear equations and for \\nraising one number to a power modulo another number. Then, it explores an impor- \\ntant application of number-theoretic algorithms: the RSA public-key cryptosystem. \\nThis cryptosystem can be used not only to encrypt m essages so that an adversary \\ncannot read them, but also to provide digital signatures. Th e chapter ûnishes with \\nthe Miller-Rabin randomized primality test, which enables ûnding large primes \\nefûciently4an essential requirement for the RSA system. \\nChapter 32 studies the problem of ûnding all occurrences of a given pattern \\nstring in a given text string, a problem that arise s frequently in text-editing pro- \\ngrams. After examining the naive approach, the chap ter pres ents an elegant ap- \\nproach due to Rabin and Karp. Then, after showing an efûcient solution based \\non ûnite automata, the chapter presents the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which \\nmodiûes the automaton-based algorithm to save space by cleverly preprocessing \\nthe pattern. The chapter ûnishes by studying sufûx arrays, which can not only ûnd \\na pattern in a text string, but can do quite a bit more, such as ûnding the longest \\nrepeated substring in a text and ûnding the longest common substring appearing in \\ntwo texts. \\nChapter 33 examines three algorithms within the expansive ûeld of machine \\nlearning. Machine-learning algorithms are designed to take in vast amounts of \\ndata, devise hypotheses about patterns in the data,  and test these hypotheses. The \\nchapter starts with k-means clustering, which groups data elements into k classes \\nbased on how similar they are to each other. It then shows how to use the technique \\nof multiplicative weights to make predictions accurately based on a set of <experts= \\nof varying quality. Perhaps surprisingly, even with out knowing which experts are \\nreliable and which are not, you can predict almost as accurately as the most reliable \\nexpert. The chapter ûnishes with gradient descent, an optimization technique that \\nûnds a local minimum value for a function.

Many interesting computational \\nproblems are NP-complete, but no polynomial-time algorithm is known for solv- \\ning any of them. This chapter presents techniques for determining when a problem \\nis NP-complete, using them to prove several classic problems NP-complete: de- \\ntermining whether a graph has a hamiltonian cycle ( a cycle that includes every \\nvertex), determining whether a boolean formula is satisûable (whether there exists \\nan assignment of boolean values to its variables th at causes the formula to eval- \\nuate to TRUE ), and determining whether a given set of numbers h as a subset that \\nadds up to a given target value. The chapter also proves that the famous traveling- \\nsalesperson problem (ûnd a shortest route that starts and ends at the same location \\nand visits each of a set of locations once) is NP-complete. \\nChapter 35 shows how to ûnd approximate solutions to NP-complete problems \\nefûciently by using approximation algorithms. For some NP-complete problems, \\napproximate solutions that are near optimal are quite easy to produce, but for oth- \\ners even the best approximation algorithms known work progressively more poorly \\nas the problem size increases. Then, there are some  problems for which investing \\nincreasing amounts of computation time yields increasingly better approximate so- \\nlutions.

This \\nchapter extends our algorithmic model to encompass parallel algorithms, where \\nmultiple instructions can execute simultaneously. Speciûcally, we’ll explore the \\nelegant model of task-parallel algorithms, which are amenable to algorithmic de- \\nsign and analysis. Our study focuses on fork-join parallel algorithms, the most \\nbasic and best understood kind of task-parallel algorithm. Fork-join parallel al- \\ngorithms can be expressed cleanly using simple ling uistic extensions to ordinary \\nserial code. Moreover, they can be implemented efûciently in practice. \\nParallel computers4computers with multiple processing units4are ubiquitous. \\nHandheld, laptop, desktop, and cloud machines are a ll multicore computers, or \\nsimply, multicores, containing multiple processing <cores.= Each proc essing core \\nis a full-üedged processor that can directly access any location in a common shared \\nmemory. Multicores can be aggregated into larger systems,  such as clusters, by \\nusing a network to interconnect them. These multicore clusters usually have a dis- \\ntributed memory, where one multicore’s memory cannot be accessed directly by a \\nprocessor in another multicore. Instead, the proces sor must explicitly send a mes- \\nsage over the cluster network to a processor in the remote multicore to request any \\ndata it requires. The most powerful clusters are supercomputers, comprising many \\nthousands of multicores. But since shared-memory programming tends to be con- \\nceptually easier than distributed-memory programming, and multicore machines \\nare widely available, this chapter focuses on parallel algorithms for multicores. \\nOne approach to programming multicores is thread parallelism. This processor- \\ncentric parallel-programming model employs a software abstraction of <virtual \\nprocessors,= or threads that share a common memory. Each thread maintains i ts \\nown program counter and can execute code independently of the other threads. The \\noperating system loads a thread onto a processing core for execution and switches \\nit out when another thread needs to run. '),\n",

One reason is that it can be complicated \\nto dynamically partition the work among the threads  so that each thread receives \\napproximately the same load. For any but the simple st of appl ications, the pro- \\ngrammer must use complex communication protocols to  implement a scheduler \\nthat load-balances the work. \\nTask-parallel programming \\nThe difûculty of thread programming has led to the creation of task-parallel plat- \\nforms, which provide a layer of software on top of threads to coordinate, schedule, \\nand manage the processors of a multicore. Some task-parallel platforms are built as \\nruntime libraries, but others provide full-üedged parallel languages with compiler \\nand runtime support. \\nTask-parallel programming allows parallelism to be speciûed in a <processor- \\noblivious= fashion, where the programmer identiûes what computational tasks may \\nrun in parallel but does not indicate which thread or processor performs the task. \\nThus, the programmer is freed from worrying about communication protocols, load \\nbalancing, and other vagaries of thread programming . The ta sk-parallel platform \\ncontains a scheduler, which automatically load-balances the tasks across the pro- \\ncessors, thereby greatly simplifying the programmer’s chore. Task-parallel algo- \\nrithms provide a natural extension to ordinary serial algo rithms, allowing perfor- \\nmance to be reasoned about mathematically using <work/span analysis.= \\nFork-join parallelism \\nAlthough the functionality of task-parallel environments is still evolving and in- \\ncreasing, almost all support fork-join parallelism, which is typically embodied \\nin two linguistic features: spawning and parallel loops. Spawning allows a sub- \\nroutine to be <forked=: executed like a subroutine call, except that the caller can \\ncontinue to execute while the spawned subroutine co mputes its result. A parallel \\nloop is like an ordinary for loop, except that multiple iterations of the loop c an \\nexecute at the same time. \\nFork-join parallel algorithms employ spawning and parallel lo ops to describe \\nparallelism. A key aspect of this parallel model, i nherited from the task-parallel \\nmodel but different from the thread model, is that the programmer does not specify \\nwhich tasks in a computation must run in parallel, only which tasks may run in \\nparallel. The underlying runtime system uses thread s to loa d-balance the tasks \\nacross the processors. This chapter investigates pa rallel algorithms described in \\nthe fork-join model, as well as how the underlying runtime system can schedule \\ntask-parallel computations (which include fork-join computations) efûciently.

We’ll discuss the theory behind task-parallel \\nschedulers shortly (on page 759). \\nA procedure cannot safely use the values returned b y its spaw ned children un- \\ntil after it executes a sync statement, as in line 5. The keyword sync indicates \\nthat the procedure must wait as necessary for all its spawned children to ûnish be- \\nfore proceeding to the statement after the sync4the <join= of a fork-join parallel \\ncomputation. The P-FIB procedure requires a sync before the return statement \\nin line 6 to avoid the anomaly that would occur if x and y were summed before \\nP-FIB.n \\ue003 1/ had ûnished and its return value had been assigned to x . In addition \\nto explicit join synchronization provided by the sync statement, it is convenient \\nto assume that every procedure executes a sync implicitly before it returns, thus \\nensuring that all children ûnish before their parent ûnishes. \\nA graph model for parallel execution \\nIt helps to view the execution of a parallel computation4the dynamic stream of \\nruntime instructions executed by processors under t he direction of a parallel pro- \\ngram4as a directed acyclic graph G D .V;E/, called a (parallel) trace. 2 Con- \\nceptually, the vertices in V are executed instructions, and the edges in E represent \\ndependencies between instructions, where .u;v/ 2 E means that the parallel pro- \\ngram required instruction u to execute before instruction v. \\nIt’s sometimes inconvenient, especially if we want to focus on the parallel struc- \\nture of a computation, for a vertex of a trace to represent only one executed instruc- \\ntion. Consequently, if a chain of instructions cont ains no parallel or procedural \\ncontrol (no spawn, sync, procedure call, or return4via either an explicit return \\nstatement or the return that happens implicitly upo n reaching the end of a proce- \\ndure), we group the entire chain into a single strand. As an example, Figure 26.2 \\nshows the trace that results from computing P-FIB.4/ in the portion of Figure 26.1 \\nshaded blue. Strands do not include instructions that involve parallel or procedural \\ncontrol. These control dependencies must be represented as edges in the trace. \\nWhen a parent procedure calls a child, the trace co ntains an edge .u;v/ from \\nthe strand u in the parent that executes the call to the ûrst strand v of the spawned \\nchild, as illustrated in Figure 26.2 by the edge from the orange strand in P-FIB.4/ \\nto the blue strand in P-FIB.2/. When the last strand v 0 in the child returns, the trace \\ncontains an edge .v 0 ;u 0 / to the strand u 0 , where u 0 is the successor strand of u in \\nthe parent, as with the edge from the white strand in P-FIB.2/ to the white strand \\nin P-FIB.4/. \\n2 Also called a computation dag in the literature.

Strands belonging to the same procedure are grouped into a rounded \\nrectangle, blue for spawned procedures and tan for called procedures. Assuming that each strand \\ntakes unit time, the work is 17 time units, since there are 17 strands, and the span is 8 time units, \\nsince the critical path4shown with blue edges4contains 8 strands. \\nWhen the parent spawns a child, however, the trace is a little different. The \\nedge .u;v/ goes from parent to child as with a call, such as the edge from the blue \\nstrand in P-FIB.4/ to the blue strand in P-FIB.3/, but the trace contains another \\nedge .u;u 0 / as well, indicating that u’s successor strand u 0 can continue to execute \\nwhile v is executing. The edge from the blue strand in P-FIB.4/ to the orange \\nstrand in P-FIB.4/ illustrates one such edge. As with a call, there is  an edge from \\nthe last strand v 0 in the child, but with a spawn, it no longer goes to u’s successor. \\nInstead, the edge is .v 0 ;x/, where x is the strand immediately following the sync in \\nthe parent that ensures that the child has ûnished, as with the edge from the white \\nstrand in P-FIB.3/ to the white strand in P-FIB.4/. \\nYou can ûgure out what parallel control created a particular trace.

If G contains a directed path from strand u to strand v, we say that the \\ntwo strands are (logically) in series. If there is no path in G either from u to v or \\nfrom v to u, the strands are (logically) in parallel. \\nA fork-join parallel trace can be pictured as a dag of strands embedded in an \\ninvocation tree of procedure instances. For example, Figure 26.1 shows the invo- \\ncation tree for F IB.6/, which also serves as the invocation tree for P-FIB.6/, the \\nedges between procedure instances now representing either calls or spawns. Fig- \\nure 26.2 zooms in on the subtree that is shaded blue, showing the strands that con- \\nstitute each procedure instance in P-FIB.4/. All directed edges connecting strands \\nrun either within a procedure or along undirected e dges of the invocation tree in \\nFigure 26.1. (More general task-parallel traces that are not fork-join traces may \\ncontain some directed edges that do not run along the undirected tree edges.) \\nOur analyses generally assume that parallel algorithms execute on an ideal par- \\nallel computer, which consists of a set of processors and a sequentially consistent \\nshared memory. To understand sequential consistency, you ûrst need to know that \\nmemory is accessed by load instructions, which copy data from a location in the \\nmemory to a register within a processor, and by store instructions, which copy data \\nfrom a processor register to a location in the memory. A single line of pseudocode \\ncan entail several such instructions. For example, the line x D y C ´ could result \\nin load instructions to fetch each of y and ´ from memory into a processor, an in- \\nstruction to add them together inside the processor, and a store instruction to place \\nthe result x back into memory. In a parallel computer, several p rocessors might \\nneed to load or store at the same time. Sequential consistency means that even if \\nmultiple processors attempt to access the memory simultaneously, the shared mem- \\nory behaves as if exactly one instruction from one of the processors is executed at \\na time, even though the actual transfer of data may  happen at the same time. It is \\nas if the instructions were executed one at a time sequentially according to some \\nglobal linear order among all the processors that preserves the individual orders in \\nwhich each processor executes its own instructions. \\nFor task-parallel computations, which are scheduled onto processors automati- \\ncally by a runtime system, the sequentially consist ent shared memory behaves as \\nif a parallel computation’s executed instructions were executed one by one in the \\norder of a topological sort (see Section 20.4) of its trace. That is, you can reason \\nabout the execution by imagining that the individual instructions (not generally the \\nstrands, which may aggregate many instructions) are  interleaved in some linear \\norder that preserves the partial order of the trace . Depending on scheduling, the \\nlinear order could vary from one run of the program  to the next, but the behavior \\nof any execution is always as if the instructions e xecuted serially in a linear order \\nconsistent with the dependencies within the trace. \\nIn addition to making assumptions about semantics, the ideal parallel-computer \\nmodel makes some performance assumptions.

Although this last assumption may sound  optimistic, it turns out that \\nfor algorithms with sufûcient <parallelism= (a term we’ll deûne precisely a little \\nlater), the overhead of scheduling is generally minimal in practice. \\nPerformance measures \\nWe can gauge the theoretical efûciency of a task-parallel algorithm using work/ \\nspan analysis, which is based on two metrics: <work= and <span.=  The work of \\na task-parallel computation is the total time to execute the entire computation on \\none processor. In other words, the work is the sum of the times taken by each of \\nthe strands. If each strand takes unit time, the wo rk is just the number of vertices \\nin the trace. The span is the fastest possible time to execute the computation on an \\nunlimited number of processors, which corresponds t o the sum of the times taken \\nby the strands along a longest path in the trace, w here <longest= means that each \\nstrand is weighted by its execution time. Such a lo ngest path is called the critical \\npath of the trace, and thus the span is the weight of th e longest (weighted) path \\nin the trace. (Section 22.2, pages 6173619 shows how to ûnd a critical path in a \\ndag G D .V;E/ in ‚.V C E/ time.) For a trace in which each strand takes unit \\ntime, the span equals the number of strands on the critical path. For example, the \\ntrace of Figure 26.2 has 17 vertices in all and 8 vertices on its critical path, so that \\nif each strand takes unit time, its work is 17 time units and its span is 8 time units. \\nThe actual running time of a task-parallel computation depends not only on its \\nwork and its span, but also on how many processors are available and how the \\nscheduler allocates strands to processors. To denot e the ru nning time of a task- \\nparallel computation on P processors, we subscript by P . For example, we might \\ndenote the running time of an algorithm on P processors by T P . The work is \\nthe running time on a single processor, or T 1 . The span is the running time if we \\ncould run each strand on its own processor4in other words, if we had an unlimited \\nnumber of processors4and so we denote the span by T 1 . \\nThe work and span provide lower bounds on the runni ng time T P of a task- \\nparallel computation on P processors: \\n\\ue001 In one step, an ideal parallel computer with P processors can do at most P \\nunits of work, and thus in T P time, it can perform at most PT P work. Since the \\ntotal work to do is T 1 , we have PT P \\ue004 T 1 . Dividing by P yields the work law: \\nT P \\ue004 T 1 =P : (26.2) \\n\\ue001 A P -processor ideal parallel computer cannot run any faster than a machine \\nwith an unlimited number of processors.

Thus, the span law follows: \\nT P \\ue004 T 1 : (26.3) \\nWe deûne the speedup of a computation on P processors by the ratio T 1 =T P , \\nwhich says how many times faster the computation ru ns on P processors than \\non one processor. By the work law, we have T P \\ue004 T 1 =P , which implies that \\nT 1 =T P හ P . Thus, the speedup on a P -processor ideal parallel computer can be \\nat most P . When the speedup is linear in the number of proce ssors, that is, when \\nT 1 =T P D ‚.P/, the computation exhibits linear speedup. Perfect linear speedup \\noccurs when T 1 =T P D P . \\nThe ratio T 1 =T 1 of the work to the span gives the parallelism of the parallel \\ncomputation. We can view the parallelism from three perspectives. As a ratio, the \\nparallelism denotes the average amount of work that  can be performed in parallel \\nfor each step along the critical path. As an upper bound, the parallelism gives the \\nmaximum possible speedup that can be achieved on any number of processors. Per- \\nhaps most important, the parallelism provides a limit on the possibility of attaining \\nperfect linear speedup. Speciûcally, once the number of processors exceeds the \\nparallelism, the computation cannot possibly achiev e perfect linear speedup. To \\nsee this last point, suppose that P >T 1 =T 1 , in which case the span law implies \\nthat the speedup satisûes T 1 =T P හ T 1 =T 1 < P . Moreover, if the number P of \\nprocessors in the ideal parallel computer greatly e xceeds the parallelism4that is, \\nif P \\ue007 T 1 =T 1 4then T 1 =T P \\ue008 P , so that the speedup is much less than the \\nnumber of processors. In other words, if the number  of processors exceeds the \\nparallelism, adding even more processors makes the speedup less perfect. \\nAs an example, consider the computation P-FIB.4/ in Figure 26.2, and assume \\nthat each strand takes unit time. Since the work is T 1 D 17 and the span is T 1 D 8, \\nthe parallelism is T 1 =T 1 D 17=8 D 2:125.

If the slackness is greater than 1, however, the work per pro- \\ncessor is the limiting constraint. We’ll see that as the slackness increases from 1, a \\ngood scheduler can achieve closer and closer to per fect linear speedup. But once \\nthe slackness is much greater than 1, the advantage of additional parallelism shows \\ndiminishing returns. \\nScheduling \\nGood performance depends on more than just minimizing the work and span. The \\nstrands must also be scheduled efûciently onto the processors of the parallel ma- \\nchine. Our fork-join parallel-programming model provides no way for a program- \\nmer to specify which strands to execute on which pr ocessors. Instead, we rely on \\nthe runtime system’s scheduler to map the dynamically unfolding computation to \\nindividual processors. In practice, the scheduler maps the strands to static threads, \\nand the operating system schedules the threads on t he processors themselves. But \\nthis extra level of indirection is unnecessary for our understanding of scheduling. \\nWe can just imagine that the scheduler maps strands to processors directly. \\nA task-parallel scheduler must schedule the computation without knowing in ad- \\nvance when procedures will be spawned or when they will ûnish4that is, it must \\noperate \\nonline. Moreover, a good scheduler operates in a distributed fashion, where \\nthe threads implementing the scheduler cooperate to load-balance the computation. \\nProvably good online, distributed schedulers exist,  but an alyzing them is compli- \\ncated. Instead, to keep our analysis simple, we’ll consider an online centralized \\nscheduler that knows the global state of the computation at any moment. \\nIn particular, we’ll analyze greedy schedulers, which assign as many strands to \\nprocessors as possible in each time step, never lea ving a processor idle if there is \\nwork that can be done. We’ll classify each step of a greedy scheduler as follows: \\n\\ue001 Complete step: At least P strands are ready to execute, meaning that all strands \\non which they depend have ûnished execution. A greedy scheduler assigns \\nany P of the ready strands to the processors, completely utilizing all the pro- \\ncessor resources. \\n\\ue001 Incomplete step: Fewer than P strands are ready to execute. A greedy sched- \\nuler assigns each ready strand to its own processor , leaving some processors \\nidle for the step, but executing all the ready strands. \\nThe work law tells us that the fastest running time  T P that we can hope for \\non P processors must be at least T 1 =P . The span law tells us that the fastest \\npossible running time must be at least T 1 . The following theorem shows that \\ngreedy scheduling is provably good in that it achieves the sum of these two lower \\nbounds as an upper bound. '),\n",

(If nec- \\nessary, replace each longer strand by a chain of unit-time strands.) We’ll consider \\ncomplete and incomplete steps separately. \\nIn each complete step, the P processors together perform a total of P work. \\nThus, if the number of complete steps is k, the total work executing all the complete \\nsteps is kP . Since the greedy scheduler doesn’t execute any strand more than once \\nand only T 1 work needs to be performed, it follows that kP හ T 1 , from which we \\ncan conclude that the number k of complete steps is at most T 1 =P . \\nNow, let’s consider an incomplete step. Let G be the trace for the entire com- \\nputation, let G 0 be the subtrace of G that has yet to be executed at the start of the \\nincomplete step, and let G 00 be the subtrace remaining to be executed after the in- \\ncomplete step. Consider the set R of strands that are ready at the beginning of the \\nincomplete step, where jRj <P . By deûnition, if a strand is ready, all its predeces- \\nsors in trace G have executed. Thus the predecessors of strands in R do not belong \\nto G 0 . A longest path in G 0 must necessarily start at a strand in R, since every other \\nstrand in G 0 has a predecessor and thus could not start a longest path. Because the \\ngreedy scheduler executes all ready strands during the incomplete step, the strands \\nof G 00 are exactly those in G 0 minus the strands in R. Consequently, the length \\nof a longest path in G 00 must be 1 less than the length of a longest path in G 0 . In \\nother words, every incomplete step decreases the span of the trace remaining to be \\nexecuted by 1. Hence, the number of incomplete steps can be at most T 1 . \\nSince each step is either complete or incomplete, the theorem follows. \\nThe following corollary shows that a greedy scheduler always performs well. \\nCorollary 26.2 \\nThe running time T P of any task-parallel computation scheduled by a greedy sched- \\nuler on a P -processor ideal parallel computer is within a factor of 2 of optimal. \\nProof Let T \\ue003 \\nP be the running time produced by an optimal scheduler on a machine \\nwith P processors, and let T 1 and T 1 be the work and span of the computation, \\nrespectively.

As a rule \\nof thumb, a slackness of at least 104that is, 10 times more parallelism than pro- \\ncessors4generally sufûces to achieve good speedup. Then, the span term in the \\ngreedy bound, inequality (26.4), is less than 10% of the work-per-processor term, \\nwhich is good enough for most engineering situations. For example, if a computa- \\ntion runs on only 10 or 100 processors, it doesn’t make sense to value parallelism \\nof, say 1,000,000, over parallelism of 10,000, even with the factor of 100 differ- \\nence. As Problem 26-2 shows, sometimes reducing extreme parallelism yields \\nalgorithms that are better with respect to other co ncerns and which still scale up \\nwell on reasonable numbers of processors. \\nAnalyzing parallel algorithms \\nWe now have all the tools we need to analyze parallel algorithms using work/span \\nanalysis, allowing us to bound an algorithm’s running time on any number of pro- \\ncessors.

As it turns out, the trace of any fork-join parallel computation can be built \\nup from single strands by series-parallel composition. \\nArmed with an understanding of series-parallel composition, we can analyze the \\nspan of P-FIB.n/. The spawned call to P-FIB.n \\ue003 1/ in line 3 runs in parallel with \\nthe call to P-FIB.n \\ue003 2/ in line 4.

Therefore, step 8 prints the value 1, rather than \\nthe value 2 that the serial projection would print. \\nLet’s recap what happened. By sequential consistency, the effect of the parallel \\nexecution is as if the executed instructions of the  two processors are interleaved. \\nIf processor 1 executes all its instructions before processor 2, a trivial interleaving, \\nthe value 2 is printed. Conversely, if processor 2 executes all its instructions before \\nprocessor 1, the value 2 is still printed. When the instructions of the two processors \\ninterleave nontrivially, however, it is possible, a s in this example execution, that \\none of the updates to x is lost, resulting in the value 1 being printed. \\nOf course, many executions do not elicit the bug. That’s the problem with deter- \\nminacy races. Generally, most instruction orderings produce correct results, such \\nas any where the instructions on the left branch ex ecute before the instructions \\non the right branch, or vice versa. But some orderi ngs generate improper results \\nwhen the instructions interleave. Consequently, races can be extremely hard to test \\nfor. Your program may fail, but you may be unable t o reliably reproduce the fail- \\nure in subsequent tests, confounding your attempts to locate the bug in your code \\nand ûx it. Task-parallel programming environments often provide race-detection \\nproductivity tools to help you isolate race bugs. \\nMany parallel programs in the real world are intent ionally nondeterministic. \\nThey contain determinacy races, but they mitigate the dangers of nondeterminism \\nthrough the use of mutual-exclusion locks and other methods of synchronization. \\nFor our purposes, however, we’ll insist on an absence of determinacy races in the \\nalgorithms we develop. Nondeterministic programs are indeed interesting, but non- \\ndeterministic programming is a more advanced topic and unnecessary for a wide \\nswath of interesting parallel algorithms. \\nTo ensure that algorithms are deterministic, any two strands that operate in par- \\nallel should be mutually noninterfering: they only read, and do not modify, any \\nmemory locations accessed by both of them. Conseque ntly, in a parallel for con- \\nstruct, such as the outer loop of P-MAT-VEC, we want all the iterations of the \\nbody, including any code an iteration executes in subroutines, to be mutually non- \\ninterfering. And between a spawn and its corresponding sync, we want the code \\nexecuted by the spawned child and the code executed by the parent to be mutually \\nnoninterfering, once again including invoked subroutines. \\nAs an example of how easy it is to write code with unintentional races, the \\nP-MAT-VEC-WRONG procedure on the next page is a faulty parallel implementa- \\ntion of matrix-vector multiplication that achieves a span of ‚.lg n/ by parallelizing \\nthe inner for loop.

Because M ERGE is serial with running time ‚.n/, both its work and \\nspan are ‚.n/. Since the serial projection of P-NAIVE -MERGE-SORT is exactly \\nMERGE-SORT, its work is T 1 .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. The two recursive calls in lines 5 \\nand 7 run in parallel, and so its span is given by the recurrence \\nT 1 .n/ D T 1 .n=2/ C ‚.n/ \\nD ‚.n/; \\nby case 1 of the master theorem. Thus the parallelism of P-NAIVE -MERGE-SORT \\nis T 1 .n/=T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg n/, which is an unimpressive amount of parallelism. T o \\nsort a million elements, for example, since lg 10 6 \\ue002 20, it might achieve linear \\nspeedup on a few processors, but it would not scale up to dozens of processors. \\nThe parallelism bottleneck in P-NAIVE -MERGE-SORT is plainly the M ERGE \\nprocedure. If we asymptotically reduce the span of merging, the master theorem \\ndictates that the span of parallel merge sort will also get smaller. When you look at \\nthe pseudocode for M ERGE, it may seem that merging is inherently serial, but it’s \\nnot. We can fashion a parallel merging algorithm. The goal is to reduce the span of \\nparallel merging asymptotically, but if we want an efûcient parallel algorithm, we \\nmust ensure that the ‚.n/ bound on work doesn’t increase. \\nFigure 26.6 depicts the divide-and-conquer strategy that we’ll use in P-MERGE. \\nThe heart of the algorithm is a recursive auxiliary procedure P-MERGE-AUX that \\nmerges two sorted subarrays of an array A into a subarray of another array B \\nin parallel. Speciûcally, P-MERGE-AUX merges AŒp 1 W r 1 � and AŒp 2 W r 2 � into \\nsubarray BŒp 3 W r 3 �, where r 3 D p 3 C .r 1 \\ue003 p 1 C 1/ C .r 2 \\ue003 p 2 C 1/ \\ue003 1 D \\np 3 C .r 1 \\ue003 p 1 / C .r 2 \\ue003 p 2 / C 1. \\nThe key idea of the recursive merging algorithm in P-MERGE-AUX is to split \\neach of the two sorted subarrays of A around a pivot x , such that all the elements \\nin the lower part of each subarray are at most x and all the elements in the upper \\npart of each subarray are at least x . The procedure can then recurse in parallel on \\ntwo subtasks: merging the two lower parts, and merg ing the two upper parts. The \\ntrick is to ûnd a pivot x so that the recursion is not too lopsided. We don’t want a \\nsituation such as that in QUICKSORT  on page 183, where bad partitioning elements \\nlead to a dramatic loss of asymptotic efûciency. We could opt to partition around \\na random element, as R ANDOMIZED -QUICKSORT  on page 192 does, but because \\nthe input subarrays are sorted, P-MERGE-AUX can quickly determine a pivot that \\nalways works well. \\nSpeciûcally, the recursive merging algorithm picks the pivot x as the middle \\nelement of the larger of the two input subarrays, w hich we can assume without \\nloss of generality is AŒp 1 W r 1 �, since otherwise, the two subarrays can just switc h \\nroles. That is, x D AŒq 1 �, where q 1 D b .p 1 C r 1 /=2c.

Intuitively, the subarray AŒp 2 W r 2 � would still be sorted if x \\nwere inserted between AŒq 2 \\ue0031� and AŒq 2 � (although the algorithm doesn’t do that). \\nSince AŒp 2 W r 2 � is sorted, a minor variant of binary search (see Exercise 2.3-6) with \\nx as the search key can ûnd the split point q 2 in ‚.lg n/ time in the worst case.

Each time through the \\nwhile loop, line 5 compares the middle element of the range with the search key x , \\nand lines 6 and 7 narrow the search range to either the lower half or the upper half \\nof the subarray, depending on the result of the test.

Since each iteration takes constant tim e, the \\nalgorithm runs in ‚.lg n/ (worst-case) time. Thus the procedure has work and \\nspan ‚.lg n/. \\nLet’s now look at the pseudocode for the parallel merging procedure P-MERGE \\non the next page. Most of the pseudocode is devoted  to the recursive procedure \\nP-MERGE-AUX. The procedure P-MERGE itself is just a <wrapper= that sets \\nup for P-MERGE-AUX. It allocates a new array BŒp W r� to hold the output of \\nP-MERGE-AUX in line 1. It then calls P-MERGE-AUX in line 2, passing the in- \\ndices of the two subarrays to be merged and providing B as the output destination \\nof the merged result, starting at index p. After P-MERGE-AUX returns, lines 334 \\nperform a parallel copy of the output BŒp W r� into the subarray AŒp W r�, which is \\nwhere P-MERGE-SORT expects it. \\nThe P-MERGE-AUX procedure is the interesting part of the algorithm. Let’s \\nstart by understanding the parameters of this recur sive parallel procedure. The \\ninput array A and the four indices p 1 ;r 1 ;p 2 ;r 2 specify the subarrays AŒp 1 W r 1 � and \\nAŒp 2 W r 2 � to be merged. The array B and the index p 3 indicate that the merged \\nresult should be stored into BŒp 3 W r 3 �, where r 3 D p 3 C .r 1 \\ue003 p 1 / C .r 2 \\ue003 p 2 / C 1, \\nas we saw earlier. The end index r 3 of the output subarray is not needed by the \\npseudocode, but it helps conceptually to name the end index, as in the comment in \\nline 13. \\nThe procedure begins by checking the base case of the recursion and doing some \\nbookkeeping to simplify the rest of the pseudocode. Lines 1 and 2 test whether the \\ntwo subarrays are both empty, in which case the procedure returns. Line 3 checks \\nwhether the ûrst subarray contains fewer elements than the second subarray. Since \\nthe number of elements in the ûrst subarray is r 1 \\ue003 p 1 C 1 and the number in the \\nsecond subarray is r 2 \\ue003 p 2 C 1, the test omits the two <C1’s.= If the ûrst subarray '),\n",

The call to F IND -SPLIT-POINT in \\nline 8 contributes ‚.lg n/ to the span in the worst case, and the procedure performs \\nat most a constant amount of additional serial work  outside of the two recursive \\nspawns in lines 12 and 14. \\nBecause the two recursive spawns operate logically in parallel, only one of them \\ncontributes to the overall worst-case span. We claimed earlier that neither recur- \\nsive invocation ever operates on more than 3n=4 elements. Let’s see why. Let \\nn 1 D r 1 \\ue003 p 1 C 1 and n 2 D r 2 \\ue003 p 2 C 1, where n D n 1 C n 2 , be the sizes of the \\ntwo subarrays when line 6 starts executing, that is, after we have established that \\nn 2 හ n 1 by swapping the roles of the two subarrays, if necessary. Since the pivot x \\nis a median of of AŒp 1 W r 1 �, in the worst case, a recursive merge involves at most \\nn 1 =2 elements of AŒp 1 W r 1 �, but it might involve all n 2 of the elements of AŒp 2 W r 2 �. \\nThus we can bound the number of elements involved i n a recursive invocation of \\nP-MERGE-AUX by \\nn 1 =2 C n 2 D .2n 1 C 4n 2 /=4 \\nහ .3n 1 C 3n 2 /=4 (since n 2 හ n 1 ) \\nD 3n=4; \\nproving the claim. \\nThe worst-case span of P-MERGE-AUX can therefore be described by the fol- \\nlowing recurrence: \\nT 1 .n/ D T 1 .3n=4/ C ‚.lg n/: (26.7) \\nBecause this recurrence falls under case 2 of the m aster theorem with k D 1, its \\nsolution is T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg 2 n/. \\nNow let’s verify that the work T 1 .n/ of P-MERGE-AUX on n elements is linear. \\nA lower bound of �.n/ is straightforward, since each of the n elements is copied \\nfrom array A to array B . We’ll show that T 1 .n/ D O.n/ by deriving a recurrence \\nfor the worst-case work. The binary search in line 8 costs ‚.lg n/ in the worst case, \\nwhich dominates the other work outside of the recursive spawns. For the recursive \\nspawns, observe that although lines 12 and 14 might merge different numbers of \\nelements, the two recursive spawns together merge a t most n \\ue003 1 elements (since \\nx D AŒq� is not merged). Moreover, as we saw when analyzing the span, a recur- \\nsive spawn operates on at most 3n=4 elements. We therefore obtain the recurrence '),\n",

The lower \\nand upper bounds of �.n/ and O.n/ give T 1 .n/ D ‚.n/, asymptotically the same \\nwork as for serial merging. \\nThe execution of the pseudocode in the P-MERGE procedure itself does not add \\nasymptotically to the work and span of P-MERGE-AUX. The parallel for loop \\nin lines 334 has ‚.lg n/ span due to the loop control, and each iteration ru ns in \\nconstant time. Thus the ‚.lg 2 n/ span of P-MERGE-AUX dominates, yielding \\n‚.lg 2 n/ span overall for P-MERGE. The parallel for loop contains ‚.n/ work, \\nmatching the asymptotic work of P-MERGE-AUX and yielding ‚.n/ work overall \\nfor P-MERGE. \\nAnalysis of parallel merge sort \\nThe <heavy lifting= is done. Now that we have deter mined the work and span of \\nP-MERGE, we can analyze P-MERGE-SORT. Let T 1 .n/ and T 1 .n/ be the work \\nand span, respectively, of P-MERGE-SORT on an array of n elements. The call to \\nP-MERGE in line 10 of P-MERGE-SORT dominates the costs of lines 133, for both \\nwork and span.

The open-source project OpenCilk (www.opencilk.org) provides \\nCilk programming as an extension to the C and C++ programming languages. All \\nof the parallel algorithms in this chapter can be coded straightforwardly in Cilk. \\nConcerns about nondeterministic parallel programs were expressed by Lee [281] \\nand Bocchino, Adve, Adve, and Snir [64].

In many situations, however, the input becomes \\navailable not in advance, but only as the algorithm executes. This idea was implicit \\nin much of the discussion of data structures in Par t III. The reason that you want \\nto design, for example, a data structure that can h andle n I NSERT , DELETE , and \\nSEARCH operations in O.lg n/ time per operation is most likely because you are \\ngoing to receive n such operation requests without knowing in advance what oper- \\nations will be coming. This idea was also implicit in amortized analysis in Chap- \\nter 16, where we saw how to maintain a table that can grow or shrink in response \\nto a sequence of insertion and deletion operations,  yet with a constant amortized \\ncost per operation. \\nAn online algorithm receives its input progressively over time, rather than hav- \\ning the entire input available at the start, as in an ofüine algorithm. Online algo- \\nrithms pertain to many situations in which informat ion arrives gradually. A stock \\ntrader must make decisions today, without knowing what the prices will be tomor- \\nrow, yet wants to achieve good returns. A computer system must schedule arriving \\njobs without knowing what work will need to be done  in the future. A store must \\ndecide when to order more inventory without knowing what the future demand will \\nbe. A driver for a ride-hailing service must decide whether to pick up a fare without \\nknowing who will request rides in the future. In each of these situations, and many \\nmore, algorithmic decisions must be made without knowledge of the future. \\nThere are several approaches for dealing with unkno wn future inputs. One ap- \\nproach is to form a probabilistic model of future i nputs and design an algorithm \\nthat assumes future inputs conform to the model. Th is technique is common, for \\nexample, in the ûeld of queuing theory, and it is also related to machine learning. \\nOf course, you might not be able to develop a workable probabilistic model, or \\neven if you can, some inputs might not conform to i t.

Instead of assuming anything about th e future input, we employ a \\nconservative strategy of limiting how poor a solution any input can entail. \\nThis chapter, therefore, adopts a worst-case approach, designing online algo- \\nrithms that guarantee the quality of the solution for all possible future inputs. We’ll \\nanalyze online algorithms by comparing the solution produced by the online algo- \\nrithm with a solution produced by an optimal algori thm that k nows the future in- \\nputs, and taking a worst-case ratio over all possible instances. We call this method- \\nology competitive analysis. We’ll use a similar approach when we study approx- \\nimation algorithms in Chapter 35, where we’ll compare the solution returned by \\nan algorithm that might be suboptimal with the valu e of the optimal solution, and \\ndetermine a worst-case ratio over all possible instances. \\nWe start with a <toy= problem: deciding between whe ther to take the elevator \\nor the stairs. This problem will introduce the basic methodology of thinking about \\nonline algorithms and how to analyze them via competitive analysis. We will then \\nlook at two problems that use competitive analysis. The ûrst is how to maintain a \\nsearch list so that the access time is not too large, and the second is about strategies \\nfor deciding which cache blocks to evict from a cache or other kind of fast computer \\nmemory. \\n27.1 Waiting for an elevator \\nOur ûrst example of an online algorithm models a problem that you likely have \\nencountered yourself: whether you should wait for an elevator to arrive or just take \\nthe stairs. Suppose that you enter a building and w ish to visi t an ofûce that is k \\nüoors up. You have two choices: walk up the stairs or take the elevator. Let’s \\nassume, for convenience, that you can climb the sta irs at the rate of one üoor per \\nminute. The elevator travels much faster than you can climb the stairs: it can ascend \\nall k üoors in just one minute. Your dilemma is that you do not know how long it \\nwill take for the elevator to arrive at the ground üoor and pick you up. Should you \\ntake the elevator or the stairs? How do you decide? \\nLet’s analyze the problem. Taking the stairs takes k minutes, no matter what. \\nSuppose you know that the elevator takes at most B \\ue003 1 minutes to arrive for some \\nvalue of B that is considerably higher than k. (The elevator could be going up \\nwhen you call for it and then stop at several üoors on its way down.) To keep \\nthings simple, let’s also assume that the number of minutes for the elevator to \\narrive is an integer. Therefore, waiting for the el evator and taking it k üoors up \\ntakes anywhere from one minute (if the elevator is already at the ground üoor) to \\n.B \\ue003 1/ C 1 D B minutes (the worst case).

If the seer knows that the elevator \\nis going to arrive in at most k \\ue003 1 minutes, the seer waits for the elevator, and \\notherwise, the seer takes the stairs. Letting m denote the number of minutes it \\ntakes for the elevator to arrive at the ground üoor, we can express the time that the \\nseer spends as the function \\nt.m/ D \\n( \\nm C 1 if m හ k \\ue003 1; \\nk if m \\ue004 k: (27.1) \\nWe typically evaluate online algorithms by their \\ncompetitive ratio. Let U denote \\nthe set (universe) of all possible inputs, and cons ider some input I 2 U. For \\na minimization problem, such as the stairs-versus-elevator problem, if an online \\nalgorithm A produces a solution with value A.I/ on input I and the solution from \\nan algorithm F that knows the future has value F.I/ on the same input, then the \\ncompetitive ratio of algorithm A is \\nmax fA.I/=F.I/  W I 2 Ug : \\nIf an online algorithm has a competitive ratio of c , we say that it is c -competitive. \\nThe competitive ratio is always at least 1, so that we want an online algorithm with \\na competitive ratio as close to 1 as possible. \\nIn the stairs-versus-elevator problem, the only input is the time for the eleva- \\ntor to arrive. Algorithm F knows this information, but an online algorithm has  \\nto make a decision without knowing when the elevato r will arrive. Consider the \\nalgorithm <always take the stairs,= which always ta kes exactly k minutes. Using \\nequation (27.1), the competitive ratio is \\nmax fk=t.m/ W 0 හ m හ B \\ue003 1g : (27.2) \\nEnumerating the terms in equation (27.2) gives the competitive ratio as \\nmax \\nï k \\n1 ; k \\n2 ; k \\n3 ;:::;  k \\n.k \\ue003 1/ ; k \\nk ; k \\nk ;:::;  k \\nk \\nð \\nD k; \\nso that the competitive ratio is k.

Because we prefer \\nthe algorithm with smaller competitive ratio, if k D 10 and B D 300, we prefer \\n<always take the stairs,= with competitive ratio 10, over <always take the elevator,= \\nwith competitive ratio 30. Taking the stairs is not always better, or necess arily \\nmore often better. It’s just that taking the stairs guards better against the worst-case \\nfuture. \\nThese two approaches of always taking the stairs and always taking the elevator \\nare extreme solutions, however.

You are given a list L of \\nn elements fx 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n g. We’ll assume that the list is doubly linked, although \\nthe algorithms and analysis work just as well for s ingly linked lists. Denote the \\nposition of element x i in the list L by r L .x i /, where 1 හ r L .x i / හ n. Calling \\nLIST-SEARCH .L;x i / on page 260 thus takes ‚.r L .x i // time. \\nIf you know in advance something about the distribution of search requests, then \\nit makes sense to arrange the list ahead of time to put the more frequently searched \\nelements closer to the front, which minimizes the t otal cost (see Exercise 27.2-1). \\nIf instead you don’t know anything about the search sequence, then no matter how \\nyou arrange the list, it is possible that every search is for whatever element appears \\nat the tail of the list. The total searching time w ould then be ‚.nm/, where m is \\nthe number of searches. \\nIf you notice patterns in the access sequence or yo u observe differences in the \\nfrequencies in which elements are accessed, then you might want to rearrange the \\nlist as you perform searches. For example, if you discover that every search is for a \\nparticular element, you could move that element to the front of the list. In general, \\nyou could rearrange the list after each call to L IST-SEARCH . But how would you \\ndo so without knowing the future? After all, no matter how you move elements \\naround, every search could be for the last element. \\nBut it turns out that some search sequences are <easier= than others. Rather than \\njust evaluate performance on the worst-case sequence, let’s compare a reorganiza- \\ntion scheme with whatever an optimal ofüine algorithm would do if it knew the \\nsearch sequence in advance. That way, if the sequen ce is fundamentally hard, the \\noptimal ofüine algorithm will also ûnd it hard, but if the sequence is easy, we can \\nhope to do reasonably well. \\nTo ease analysis, we’ll drop the asymptotic notation and say that the cost is \\njust i to search for the i th element in the list. Let’s also assume that the only way \\nto reorder the elements in the list is by swapping two adjacent elements in the list. \\nBecause the list is doubly linked, each swap incurs a cost of 1. Thus, for example, \\na search for the sixth element followed by moving it forward two places (entailing \\ntwo swaps) incurs a total cost 8. The goal is to minimize the total cost of calls t o \\nLIST-SEARCH plus the total number of swaps performed. \\nThe online algorithm that we’ll explore is MOVE-TO-FRONT .L;x/. This proce- \\ndure ûrst searches for x in the doubly linked list L, and then it moves x to the front \\nof the list. 1 If x is located at position r D r L .x/ before the call, MOVE-TO-FRONT \\nswaps x with the element in position r \\ue003 1, then with the element in position r \\ue003 2, \\n1 The path-compression heuristic in Section 19.3 resembles MOVE-TO-FRONT, although it would \\nbe more accurately expressed as <move-to-next-to-front.= Unlike M OVE-TO-FRONT in a doubly \\nlinked list, path compression can relocate multiple elements to become <next-to-front.= '),\n",

Let’s think about \\nwhat this means. M OVE-TO-FRONT performs a series of operations on a doubly \\nlinked list, accumulating cost. For comparison, sup pose that there is an algorithm \\nFORESEE that knows the future. Like M OVE-TO-FRONT, it also searches the list \\nand moves elements around, but after each call it o ptimally rearranges the list for \\nthe future. (There may be more than one optimal ord er.) Thus F ORESEE and \\nMOVE-TO-FRONT maintain different lists of the same elements. \\nConsider the example shown in Figure 27.1. Starting with the list h1;2;3;4;5 i , \\nfour searches occur, for the elements 5, 3, 4, and 4. The hypothetical procedure \\nFORESEE, after searching for 3, moves 4 to the front of the list, knowing that a \\nsearch for 4 is imminent. It thus incurs a swap cost of 3 upon its second call, after \\nwhich no further swap costs accrue. M OVE-TO-FRONT incurs swap costs in each \\nstep, moving the found element to the front. In thi s example, M OVE-TO-FRONT \\nhas a higher cost in each step, but that is not necessarily always the case. \\nThe key to proving the competitive bound is to show that at any point, the total \\ncost of MOVE-TO-FRONT is not much higher than that of FORESEE. Surprisingly, \\nwe can determine a bound on the costs incurred by M OVE-TO-FRONT relative to \\nFORESEE even though MOVE-TO-FRONT cannot see the future. \\nIf we compare any particular step, MOVE-TO-FRONT and FORESEE may be op- \\nerating on very different lists and do very different things. If we focus on the search \\nfor 4 above, we observe that FORESEE actually moves it to the front of the list early, \\npaying to move the element to the front before it is accessed.

The blocks requested are not necessarily \\ndistinct: each block may appear multiple times within the request sequence. After \\nblock b i is requested, it resides in a cache that can hold up to k blocks, where k is \\na ûxed cache size. We assume that n>k , since otherwise we are assured that the \\ncache can hold all the requested blocks at once. When a block b i is requested, if it \\nis already in the cache, then a cache hit occurs and the cache remains unchanged. \\nIf b i is not in the cache, then a cache miss occurs. If the cache contains fewer \\nthan k blocks upon a cache miss, block b i is placed into the cache, which now \\ncontains one block more than before. If a cache mis s occurs with an already full \\ncache, however, some block must be evicted from the  cache before b i can enter. \\nThus, a caching algorithm must decide which block t o evict from the cache upon \\na cache miss when the cache is full. The goal is to  minimize the number of cache \\nmisses over the entire request sequence. The caching algorithms considered in this \\nchapter differ only in which block they decide to e vict upon a cache miss. We \\ndo not consider abilities such as prefetching, in w hich a block is brought into the \\ncache before an upcoming request in order to avert a future cache miss. \\nThere are many online caching policies to determine  which bl ock to evict, in- \\ncluding the following: \\n\\ue001 First-in, ûrst-out (FIFO): evict the block that has been in the cache the longest \\ntime. \\n\\ue001 Last-in, ûrst-out (LIFO): evict the block that has been in the cache the shortest \\ntime. \\n\\ue001 Least Recently Used (LRU): evict the block whose la st use is furthest in the \\npast. \\n\\ue001 Least Frequently Used (LFU): evict the block that has been accessed the fewest \\ntimes, breaking ties by choosing the block that has been in the cache the longest. \\nTo analyze these algorithms, we assume that the cache starts out empty, so that \\nno evictions occur during the ûrst k requests. We wish to compare the perfor- \\nmance of an online algorithm to an optimal ofüine algorithm that knows the future \\nrequests. As we will soon see, all these determinis tic online algorithms have a \\nlower bound of �.k/ for their competitive ratio. Some deterministic alg orithms \\nalso have a competitive ratio with an O.k/ upper bound, but some other determin- \\nistic algorithms are considerably worse, having a competitive ratio of ‚.n=k/. \\nWe now proceed to analyze the LIFO and LRU policies. In addition to assuming \\nthat n>k , we will assume that at least k distinct blocks are requested. Otherwise, \\nthe cache never ûlls up and no blocks are evicted, so that all algorithms exhibit the \\nsame behavior. We begin by showing that LIFO has a large competitive ratio. '),\n",

Suppose that the input consists \\nof k C 1 blocks, numbered 1;2;:::;k  C 1, and the request sequence is \\n1; 2; 3; 4; :::; k; k C 1; k; k C 1; k; k C 1; ::: ; \\nwhere after the initial 1;2;:::;k;k  C 1, the remainder of the sequence alternates \\nbetween k and k C 1, with a total of n requests. The sequence ends on block k \\nif n and k are either both even or both odd, and otherwise, th e sequence ends on \\nblock kC1. That is, b i D i for i D 1;2;:::k \\ue0031, b i D kC1 for i D kC1;kC3;:::  \\nand b i D k for i D k;k C 2;::: . How many blocks does LIFO evict? After the \\nûrst k requests (which are considered to be cache misses),  the cache is ûlled with \\nblocks 1;2;:::;k . The .k C 1/st request, which is for block k C 1, causes block k \\nto be evicted. The .k C 2/nd request, which is for block k, forces block k C 1 to be \\nevicted, since that block was just placed into the cache. This behavior continues, \\nalternately evicting blocks k and k C 1 for the remaining requests. LIFO, therefore, \\nsuffers a cache miss on every one of the n requests. \\nThe optimal ofüine algorithm knows the entire sequence of requests in advance. \\nUpon the ûrst request of block k C 1, it just evicts any block except block k, and \\nthen it never evicts another block. Thus, the optimal ofüine algorithm evicts only \\nonce. Since the ûrst k requests are considered cache misses, the total num ber of \\ncache misses is k C 1. The competitive ratio, therefore, is n=.k C 1/, or �.n=k/. \\nFor the upper bound, observe that on any input of size n, any caching algorithm \\nincurs at most n cache misses. Because the input contains at least k distinct blocks, \\nany caching algorithm, including the optimal ofüine algorithm, must incur at least \\nk cache misses. Therefore, LIFO has a competitive ratio of O.n=k/. \\nWe call such a competitive ratio unbounded, because it grows with the input \\nsize. Exercise 27.3-2 asks you to show that LFU also has an unbounded competitive \\nratio. \\nFIFO and LRU have a much better competitive ratio of ‚.k/. There is a big \\ndifference between competitive ratios of ‚.n=k/ and ‚.k/. The cache size k is \\nindependent of the input sequence and does not grow as more requests arrive over \\ntime. A competitive ratio that depends on n, on the other hand, does grow with \\nthe size of the input sequence and thus can get qui te large. It is preferable to use \\nan algorithm with a competitive ratio that does not grow with the input sequence’s \\nsize, when possible. \\nWe now show that LRU has a competitive ratio of ‚.k/, ûrst showing the upper \\nbound.

Epoch i , for i > 1, begins upon encoun- \\ntering the .k C 1/st distinct request since the beginning of epoch i \\ue003 1. Consider \\nthe following example of requests with k D 3: \\n1; 2; 1; 5; 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2; 3; 4; 5; 2; 2; 1; 2; 2: (27.10) \\nThe ûrst k D 3 distinct requests are for blocks 1, 2 and 5, so epoch 2 begins with \\nthe ûrst request for block 4. In epoch 2, the ûrst 3 distinct requests are for blocks \\n4, 1, and 2. Requests for these blocks recur until the request  for block 3, and with \\nthis request epoch 3 begins. Thus, this example has four epochs: \\n1; 2; 1; 5 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 2; 1; 2; 2: (27.11) \\nNow we consider the behavior of LRU. In each epoch, the ûrst time a re- \\nquest for a particular block appears, it may cause a cache miss, but subsequent \\nrequests for that block within the epoch cannot cause a cache miss, since the block \\nis now one of the k most recently used. For example, in epoch 2, the ûrst request \\nfor block 4 causes a cache miss, but the subsequent requests fo r block 4 do not. \\n(Exercise 27.3-1 asks you to show the contents of the cache after each request.) In \\nepoch 3, requests for blocks 3 and 5 cause cache misses, but the request for block 4 \\ndoes not, because it was recently accessed in epoch 2. Since only the ûrst request \\nfor a block within an epoch can cause a cache miss and the cache holds k blocks, \\neach epoch incurs at most k cache misses. \\nNow consider the behavior of the optimal algorithm. The ûrst request in each \\nepoch must cause a cache miss, even for an optimal algorithm. The miss occurs be- \\ncause, by the deûnition of an epoch, there must have been k other blocks accessed \\nsince the last access to this block. \\nSince, for each epoch, the optimal algorithm incurs  at least one miss and LRU \\nincurs at most k, the competitive ratio is at most k=1 D O.k/. \\nExercise 27.3-3 asks you to show that FIFO also has a competitive ratio of O.k/. \\nWe could show lower bounds of �.k/ on LRU and FIFO, but in fact, we can \\nmake a much stronger statement: any deterministic online caching algorithm must \\nhave a competitive ratio of �.k/. The proof relies on an adversary who knows the \\nonline algorithm being used and can tailor the futu re requests to cause the online \\nalgorithm to incur more cache misses than the optimal ofüine algorithm. \\nConsider a scenario in which the cache has size k and the set of possible blocks \\nto request is f1;2;:::;k  C 1g.

The next request is for block k C 1. In order to make room in \\nthe cache for block k C 1, the online algorithm evicts some block b 1 from the \\ncache. The adversary, knowing that the online algorithm has just evicted block b 1 , \\nmakes the next request be for b 1 , so that the online algorithm must evict some \\nother block b 2 to clear room in the cache for b 1 . As you might have guessed, the \\nadversary makes the next request be for block b 2 , so that the online algorithm evicts \\nsome other block b 3 to make room for b 2 . The online algorithm and the adversary \\ncontinue in this manner. The online algorithm incurs a cache miss on every request \\nand therefore incurs n cache misses over the n requests. \\nNow let’s consider an optimal ofüine algorithm, which knows the future. As dis- \\ncussed in Section 15.4, this algorithm is known as furthest-in-future, and it always \\nevicts the block whose next request is furthest in the future. Since there are only \\nk C 1 unique blocks, when furthest-in-future evicts a block, we know that it will \\nnot be accessed during at least the next k requests. Thus, after the ûrst k cache \\nmisses, the optimal algorithm incurs a cache miss a t most once every k requests. \\nTherefore, the number of cache misses over n requests is at most k C n=k. \\nSince the deterministic online algorithm incurs n cache misses and the optimal \\nofüine algorithm incurs at most k C n=k cache misses, the competitive ratio is at \\nleast \\nn \\nk C n=k D nk \\nn C k 2 : \\nFor n \\ue004 k 2 , the above expression is at least \\nnk \\nn C k 2 \\ue004 nk \\n2n D k \\n2 : \\nThus, for sufûciently long request sequences, we have shown the following: \\nTheorem 27.4 \\nAny deterministic online algorithm for caching with a cache size of k has compet- \\nitive ratio �.k/. \\nAlthough we can analyze the common caching strategies from the point of view \\nof competitive analysis, the results are somewhat u nsatisfying.

Before describing the algorithm, let’s discuss randomization in online \\nalgorithms in general. Recall that we analyze onlin e algorithms with respect to \\nan adversary who knows the online algorithm and can design requests knowing the \\ndecisions made by the online algorithm. With randomization, we must ask whether \\nthe adversary also knows the random choices made by the online algorithm. An ad- \\nversary who does not know the random choices is oblivious, and an adversary who \\nknows the random choices is nonoblivious. Ideally, we prefer to design algorithms \\nagainst a nonoblivious adversary, as this adversary  is stronger than an oblivious \\none. Unfortunately, a nonoblivious adversary mitigates much of the power of ran- \\ndomness, as an adversary who knows the outcome of random choices typically can \\nact as if the online algorithm is deterministic. The oblivious adversary, on the other \\nhand, does not know the random choices of the onlin e algorithm, and that is the \\nadversary we typically use. \\nAs a simple illustration of the difference between an oblivious and nonoblivious \\nadversary, imagine that you are üipping a fair coin n times, and the adversary wants \\nto know how many heads you üipped. A nonoblivious adversary knows, after each \\nüip, whether the coin came up heads or tails, and hence knows how many heads \\nyou üipped. An oblivious adversary, on the other hand, knows only that you are \\nüipping a fair coin n times. The oblivious adversary, therefore, can reas on that \\nthe number of heads follows a binomial distribution , so that the expected number \\nof heads is n=2 (by equation (C.41) on page 1199) and the variance is n=4 (by \\nequation (C.44) on page 1200). But the oblivious adversary has no way of knowing \\nexactly how many heads you actually üipped. \\nLet’s return to caching. We’ll start with a deterministic algorithm and then ran- \\ndomize it. The algorithm we’ll use is an approximation of LRU called MARKING . \\nRather than <least recently used,= think of M ARKING as simply <recently used.= \\nMARKING maintains a 1-bit attribute mark for each block in the cache. Initially, \\nall blocks in the cache are unmarked. When a block is requested, if it is already \\nin the cache, it is marked. If the request is a cac he miss, M ARKING checks to \\nsee whether there are any unmarked blocks in the cache. If all blocks are marked, \\nthen they are all changed to unmarked. Now, regardl ess of whether all blocks in \\nthe cache were marked when the request occurred, th ere is at least one unmarked \\nblock in the cache, and so an arbitrary unmarked block is evicted, and the requested \\nblock is placed into the cache and marked. \\nHow should the block to evict from among the unmark ed blocks in the cache \\nbe chosen?

Therefore, the number of mark ed blocks monotonically \\nincreases within an epoch. Under this view, epochs are the same as in the proof of \\nTheorem 27.3: with a cache that holds k blocks, an epoch comprises requests for k \\ndistinct blocks (possibly fewer for the ûnal epoch), and the next epoch begins upon \\na request for a block not in those k. \\nBecause we are going to analyze a randomized algori thm, we will compute the \\nexpected competitive ratio.

The key to the improved competitive ratio is that  the adversary \\ncannot always make a request for a block that is not in the cache, since an oblivious \\nadversary does not know which blocks are in the cache.

You repeatedly choose a ball at random and remove it from the bag until you \\nhave chosen a total of m balls that are either blue or red, where m හ x . You set \\naside each white ball you choose. Then, one of the balls chosen is the red ball with \\nprobability m=x . \\nProof Choosing a white ball does not affect how many blue or red balls are cho- \\nsen in any way. Therefore, we can continue the anal ysis as if there were no white \\nballs and the bag contains just x \\ue003 1 blue balls and 1 red ball. \\nLet A be the event that the red ball is not chosen, and let A i be the event that the \\ni th draw does not choose the red ball.

Within \\nepoch i , any request for a block b that is not the ûrst request for block b in epoch i \\nmust result in a cache hit, since after the ûrst request in epoch i , block b resides in \\nthe cache and is marked, so that it cannot be evict ed during the epoch. Therefore, \\nsince we are counting cache misses, we’ll consider only the ûrst request for each \\nblock within each epoch, disregarding all other requests. \\nWe can classify the requests in an epoch as either old or new. If block b resides \\nin the cache at the start of epoch i , each request for block b during epoch i is an \\nold request. Old requests in epoch i are for blocks requested in epoch i \\ue003 1. If a \\nrequest in epoch i is not old, it is a new request, and it is for a block not requested \\nin epoch i \\ue003 1. All requests in epoch 1 are new. For example, let’s look again at \\nthe request sequence in example (27.11): \\n1; 2; 1; 5 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 2; 1; 2; 2: \\nSince we can disregard all requests for a block within an epoch other than the ûrst \\nrequest, to analyze the cache behavior, we can view this request sequence as just \\n1; 2; 5 4; 1; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 1: \\nAll three requests in epoch 1 are new. In epoch 2, the requests for blocks 1 and 2 \\nare old, but the request for block 4 is new. In epoch 3, the request for block 4 is \\nold, and the requests for blocks 3 and 5 are new. Both requests in epoch 4 are new. \\nWithin an epoch, each new request must cause a cache miss since, by deûnition, \\nthe block is not already in the cache. An old reque st, on the other hand, may or \\nmay not cause a cache miss. The old block is in the  cache at the beginning of the \\nepoch, but other requests might cause it to be evic ted. Returning to our example, \\nin epoch 2, the request for block 4 must cause a cache miss, as this request is \\nnew. The request for block 1, which is old, may or may not cause a cache miss. \\nIf block 1 was evicted when block 4 was requested, then a cache miss occurs and \\nblock 1 must be brought back into the cache. If instead blo ck 1 was not evicted \\nwhen block 4 was requested, then the request for block 1 results in a cache hit. The \\nrequest for block 2 could incur a cache miss under two scenarios. One is if block 2 \\nwas evicted when block 4 was requested. The other is if block 1 was evicted when \\nblock 4 was requested, and then block 2 was evicted when block 1 was requested. \\nWe see that, within an epoch, each ensuing old request has an increasing chance of \\ncausing a cache miss. \\nBecause we consider only the ûrst request for each block within an epoch, we \\nassume that each epoch contains exactly k requests, and each request within an \\nepoch is for a unique block. (The last epoch might contain fewer than k requests. \\nIf it does, just add dummy requests to ûll it out to k requests.) In epoch i , denote \\nthe number of new requests by r i \\ue004 1 (an epoch must contain at least one new '),\n",

As mentioned above, a new \\nrequest always incurs a cache miss. \\nLet us now focus on an arbitrary epoch i to obtain a bound on the expected \\nnumber of cache misses within that epoch. In partic ular, let’s think about the j th \\nold request within the epoch, where 1 හ j <k. Denote by b ij the block requested \\nin the j th old request of epoch i , and denote by n ij and o ij the number of new \\nand old requests, respectively, that occur within e poch i but before the j th old \\nrequest. Because j \\ue003 1 old requests occur before the j th old request, we have \\no ij D j \\ue003 1. We will show that the probability of a cache miss  upon the j th old \\nrequest is n ij =.k \\ue003 o ij /, or n ij =.k \\ue003 j C 1/. \\nStart by considering the ûrst old request, for block b i;1 . What is the probability \\nthat this request causes a cache miss? It causes a cache miss precisely when one \\nof the n i;1 previous requests resulted in b i;1 being evicted. We can determine the \\nprobability that b i;1 was chosen for eviction by using Lemma 27.6: consider the k \\nblocks in the cache to be k balls, with block b i;1 as the red ball, the other k \\ue003 1 \\nblocks as the k \\ue003 1 blue balls, and no white balls. Each of the n i;1 requests chooses \\na block to evict with equal probability, correspond ing to drawing balls n i;1 times. \\nThus, we can apply Lemma 27.6 with x D k, y D 0, and m D n i;1 , deriving \\nthe probability of a cache miss upon the ûrst old request as n i;1 =k, which equals \\nn ij =.k \\ue003 j C 1/ since j D 1. \\nIn order to determine the probability of a cache miss for subsequent old requests, \\nwe’ll need an additional observation. Let’s consider the second old request, which \\nis for block b i;2 . This request causes a cache miss precisely when o ne of the pr e- \\nvious requests evicts b i;2 . Let’s consider two cases, based on the request for b i;1 . \\nIn the ûrst case, suppose that the request for b i;1 did not cause an eviction, because \\nb i;1 was already in the cache. Then, the only way that b i;2 could have been evicted \\nis by one of the n i;2 new requests that precedes it. What is the probabil ity that \\nthis eviction happens? There are n i;2 chances for b i;2 to be evicted, but we also \\nknow that there is one block in the cache, namely b i;1 , that is not evicted. Thus, \\nwe can again apply Lemma 27.6, but with b i;1 as the white ball, b i;2 as the red \\nball, the remaining blocks as the blue balls, and drawing balls n i;2 times. Applying \\nLemma 27.6, with x D k \\ue003 1, y D 1, and m D n i;2 , we ûnd that the probability of \\na cache miss is n i;2 =.k \\ue003 1/. In the second case, the request for b i;1 does cause an \\neviction, which can happen only if one of the new r equests preceding the request \\nfor b i;1 evicts b i;1 . Then, the request for b i;1 brings b i;1 back into the cache and \\nevicts some other block. In this case, we know that  of the new requests, one of \\nthem did not result in b i;2 being evicted, since b i;1 was evicted. Therefore, n i;2 \\ue003 1 \\nnew requests could evict b i;2 , as could the request for b i;1 , so that the number of \\nrequests that could evict b i;2 is n i;2 . Each such request evicts a block chosen from \\namong k \\ue003 1 blocks, since the request that resulted in evicting  b i;1 did not also \\ncause b i;2 to be evicted. Therefore, we can apply Lemma 27.6, with x D k \\ue003 1, '),\n",

In both \\ncases the probability is the same, and it equals n ij =.k \\ue003 j C 1/ since j D 2. \\nMore generally, o ij old requests occur before the j th old request. Each of these \\nprior old requests either caused an eviction or did  not. For those that caused an \\neviction, it is because they were evicted by a previous request, and for those that did \\nnot cause an eviction, it is because they were not evicted by any previous request. \\nIn either case, we can decrease the number of block s that the random process is \\nchoosing from by 1 for each old request, and thus o ij requests cannot cause b ij to \\nbe evicted. Therefore, we can use Lemma 27.6 to determine the probability that \\nb ij was evicted by a previous request, with x D k \\ue003 o ij , y D o ij and m D n ij . \\nThus, we have proven our claim that the probability  of a cache miss on the j th \\nrequest for an old block is n ij =.k \\ue003 o ij /, or n ij =.k \\ue003 j C 1/. Since n ij හ r i (recall \\nthat r i is the number of new requests during epoch i ), we have an upper bound of \\nr i =.k \\ue003 j C 1/ on the probability that the j th old request incurs a cache miss. \\nWe can now compute the expected number of misses during epoch i using indi- \\ncator random variables, as introduced in Section 5.2.

Now you will develop an online algorithm for nonpreemptively scheduling a \\nset of tasks with release times. Suppose you are given a set S D fa 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  n g of \\ntasks, where task a i has release time r i , before which it cannot start, and requires \\np i units of processing time to complete once it has started. You have one computer \\non which to run the tasks. Tasks cannot be preempted, which is to say that once \\nstarted, a task must run to completion without interruption. (See Problem 15-2 on \\npage 446 for a more detailed description of this problem.) Given a schedule, let \\nC i be the completion time of task a i , that is, the time at which task a i completes \\nprocessing.

Then by Corollary D.3 on page 1221, \\nthere exists a nonzero vector x such that Ax D 0. Hence, x T Ax D 0, and A cannot \\nbe positive-deûnite. \\nThe proof that an LU decomposition on a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix A \\nwon’t divide by 0 is more involved. We begin by proving properties about certain \\nsubmatrices of A. Deûne the kth leading submatrix of A to be the matrix A k \\nconsisting of the intersection of the ûrst k rows and ûrst k columns of A. \\nLemma 28.4 \\nIf A is a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix, then every leading submatrix of A is \\nsymmetric and positive-deûnite. \\nProof Since A is symmetric, each leading submatrix A k is also symmetric. We’ll \\nprove that A k is positive-deûnite by contradiction. If A k is not positive-deûnite, \\nthen there exists a k-vector x k ¤ 0 such that x T \\nk A k x k හ 0. Let A be n \\ue005 n, and \\nA D \\nÏ A k B T \\nB C  \\nÐ \\n(28.16) \\nfor submatrices B (which is .n \\ue003 k/ \\ue005 k) and C (which is .n \\ue003 k/ \\ue005 .n \\ue003 k/). Deûne \\nthe n-vector x D .x T \\nk 0/ T , where n \\ue003 k0s follow x k . Then we have \\nx T Ax D .x T \\nk 0/ \\nÏ A k B T \\nB C  \\nÐÏ x k \\n0 \\nÐ \\nD .x T \\nk 0/ \\nÏ A k x k \\nBx k \\nÐ \\nD x T \\nk A k x k \\nහ 0; \\nwhich contradicts A being positive-deûnite. \\nWe now turn to some essential properties of the Schur complement. Let A be a \\nsymmetric positive-deûnite matrix, and let A k be a leading k \\ue005 k submatrix of A. \\nPartition A once again according to equation (28.16). Equation (28.10) generalizes \\nto deûne the Schur complement S of A with respect to A k as \\nS D C \\ue003 BA \\ue0021 \\nk B T : (28.17) \\n(By Lemma 28.4, A k is symmetric and positive-deûnite, and therefore, A \\ue0021 \\nk exists \\nby Lemma 28.3, and S is well deûned.) The earlier deûnition (28.10) of the Schur \\ncomplement is consistent with equation (28.17) by letting k D 1. \\nThe next lemma shows that the Schur-complement matrices of symmetric posi- \\ntive-deûnite matrices are themselves symmetric and positive-deûnite.

By Exercise D.2-6 on \\npage 1223, the product BA \\ue0021 \\nk B T is symmetric. Since C and BA \\ue0021 \\nk B T are symmet- \\nric, then by Exercise D.1-1 on page 1219, so is S . \\nIt remains to show that S is positive-deûnite. Consider the partition of A given in \\nequation (28.16). For any nonzero vector x , we have x T Ax>0  by the assumption \\nthat A is positive-deûnite. Let the subvectors y and ´ consist of the ûrst k and last \\nn \\ue003 k elements in x , respectively, and thus they are compatible with A k and C , \\nrespectively.

(See Exercise 28.3-2.) \\nSince x T Ax >0 holds for any nonzero x , pick any nonzero ´ and then choose \\ny D \\ue003A \\ue0021 \\nk B T ´, which causes the ûrst term in equation (28.18) to vanish, leaving \\n´ T .C \\ue003 BA \\ue0021 \\nk B T /´ D ´ T S´ \\nas the value of the expression.

Since the ûrst step of LU decomposition produces the Schur complement \\nof A with respect to A 1 D .a 11 /, Lemma 28.5 implies by induction that all pivots \\nare positive. \\nLeast-squares approximation \\nOne important application of symmetric positive-deûnite matrices arises in ûtting \\ncurves to given sets of data points. You are given a set of m data points \\n.x 1 ;y 1 /;.x 2 ;y 2 /;:::;.x  m ;y m /; \\nwhere you know that the y i are subject to measurement errors. You wish to deter- \\nmine a function F.x/ such that the approximation errors \\nශ i D F.x i / \\ue003 y i (28.19) \\nare small for i D 1;2;:::;m . The form of the function F depends on the problem \\nat hand. Let’s assume that it has the form of a linearly weighted sum \\nF.x/ D \\nn X \\nj D1 \\nc j f j .x/; \\nwhere the number n of summands and the speciûc basis functions f j are chosen \\nbased on knowledge of the problem at hand. A common  choice is f j .x/ D x j \\ue0021 , \\nwhich means that \\nF.x/ D c 1 C c 2 x C c 3 x 2 C \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 C c n x n\\ue0021 \\nis a polynomial of degree n \\ue003 1 in x . Thus, if you are given m data points \\n.x 1 ;y 1 /;.x 2 ;y 2 /;:::;.x  m ;y m /, you need to calculate n coefûcients c 1 ;c 2 ;:::;c  n \\nthat minimize the approximation errors ශ 1 ; ශ \\n2 ; : : : ; ශ m . \\nBy choosing n D m, you can calculate each y i exactly in equation (28.19). \\nSuch a high-degree polynomial F <ûts the noise= as well as the data, however, and \\ngenerally gives poor results when used to predict y for previously unseen values \\nof x . It is usually better to choose n signiûcantly smaller than m and hope that \\nby choosing the coefûcients c j well, you can obtain a function F that ûnds the \\nsigniûcant patterns in the data points without paying undue attention to the noise. \\nSome theoretical principles exist for choosing n, but they are beyond the scope of \\nthis text. In any case, once you choose a value of n that is less than m, you end up \\nwith an overdetermined set of equations whose solution you wish to approximate. \\nLet’s see how to do so. '),\n",

The SVD factors an m \\ue005 n matrix A into A D Q 1 †Q T \\n2 , where † is an \\nm \\ue005 n matrix with nonzero values only on the diagonal, Q 1 is m \\ue005 m with mutually \\northonormal columns, and Q 2 is n \\ue005 n, also with mutually orthonormal columns. \\nTwo vectors are orthonormal if their inner product is 0 and each vector has a norm \\nof 1. The books by Strang [422, 423] and Golub and Van Loan [192] contain good \\ntreatments of the SVD. \\nStrang [423] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-deûnite matri- \\nces and of linear algebra in general.

If you  can specify the objective as \\na linear function of certain variables, and if you can specify the constraints on \\nresources as equalities or inequalities on those va riables, then you have a linear- \\nprogramming problem. Linear programs arise in a variety of practical applica- \\ntions. We begin by studying an application in electoral politics. \\nA political problem \\nSuppose that you are a politician trying to win an election. Your district has three \\ndifferent types of areas4urban, suburban, and rural. These areas have, respec- \\ntively, 100,000, 200,000, and 50,000 registered voters. Although not all the reg- \\nistered voters actually go to the polls, you decide  that to govern effectively, you \\nwould like at least half the registered voters in e ach of the three regions to vote \\nfor you. You are honorable and would never consider  supporting policies you \\ndon’t believe in. You realize, however, that certain issues may be more effective \\nin winning votes in certain places. Your primary issues are preparing for a zombie \\napocalypse, equipping sharks with lasers, building highways for üying cars, and \\nallowing dolphins to vote. \\nAccording to your campaign staff’s research, you can estimate how many votes \\nyou win or lose from each population segment by spending $1,000 on advertising \\non each issue. This information appears in the tabl e of Figur e 29.1. In this table, \\neach entry indicates the number of thousands of eit her urban, suburban, or rural \\nvoters who would be won over by spending $1,000 on advertising in support of a \\nparticular issue.

Your task is to \\nûgure out the minimum amount of money that you need to spend in order to win \\n50,000 urban votes, 100,000 suburban votes, and 25,000 rural votes. \\nYou could, by trial and error, devise a strategy th at wins the required number \\nof votes, but the strategy you come up with might n ot be the least expensive one. \\nFor example, you could devote $20,000 of advertisin g to preparing for a zombie '),\n",

In order to garn er these votes, you would have \\npaid for 20 C 0 C 4 C 9 D 33 thousand dollars of advertising. \\nIt’s natural to wonder whether this strategy is the best possible. That is, can you \\nachieve your goals while spending less on advertising? Additional trial and error \\nmight help you to answer this question, but a bette r approach is to formulate (or \\nmodel) this question mathematically. \\nThe ûrst step is to decide what decisions you have to make and to introduce \\nvariables that capture these decisions.

In- \\nstead, we will give an example that demonstrates so me ideas behind the simplex \\nalgorithm, which is currently the most commonly deployed solution method. \\nGeneral linear programs \\nIn the general linear-programming problem, we wish to optimize a linear function \\nsubject to a set of linear inequalities. Given a set of real numbers a 1 ;a 2 ;:::;a  n and \\na set of variables x 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n , we deûne a linear function f on those variables \\nby \\nf.x 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n / D a 1 x 1 C a 2 x 2 C \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 C a n x n D \\nn X \\nj D1 \\na j x j : \\nIf b is a real number and f is a linear function, then the equation \\nf.x 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n / D b \\nis a \\nlinear equality and the inequalities \\nf.x 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n / හ b and f.x 1 ;x 2 ;:::;x  n / \\ue004 b \\nare linear inequalities. We use the general term linear constraints to denote either \\nlinear equalities or linear inequalities. Linear pr ogramming does not allow strict \\ninequalities. Formally, a linear-programming problem is the problem of either \\nminimizing or maximizing a linear function subject to a ûnite set of linear con- \\nstraints. If minimizing, we call the linear program a minimization linear program, \\nand if maximizing, we call the linear program a maximization linear program. \\nIn order to discuss linear-programming algorithms and properties, it will be \\nhelpful to use a standard notation for the input.

If we create  an m \\ue005 n matrix A D .a ij /, \\nan m-vector b D .b i /, an n-vector c D .c j /, and an n-vector x D .x j /, then we \\ncan rewrite the linear program deûned in (29.11)3(29.13) as \\nmaximize c T x (29.14) \\nsubject to \\nAx හ b (29.15) \\nx \\ue004 0 : (29.16) \\nIn line (29.14), c T x is the inner product of two n-vectors.

For example, you might have equality constraints or variables \\nthat can take on negative values. Exercises 29.1-6 and 29.1-7 ask you to show how \\nto convert any linear program into this standard form. \\nWe now introduce terminology to describe solutions to linear programs. We \\ndenote a particular setting of the values in a vari able, say x , by putting a bar over \\nthe variable name: N x. If N x satisûes all the constraints, then it is a feasible solution, \\nbut if it fails to satisfy at least one constraint, then it is an infeasible solution. We \\nsay that a solution N x has objective value c T N x. A feasible solution N x whose objective \\nvalue is maximum over all feasible solutions is an optimal solution, and we call \\nits objective value c T N x the optimal objective value. If a linear program has no \\nfeasible solutions, we say that the linear program is infeasible, and otherwise, it \\nis feasible. The set of points that satisfy all the constraint s is the feasible region. \\nIf a linear program has some feasible solutions but  does not h ave a ûnite optimal \\nobjective value, then the feasible region is unbounded and so is the linear program. \\nExercise 29.1-5 asks you to show that a linear program can have a ûnite optimal \\nobjective value even if the feasible region is unbounded.

There are two classes of \\nalgorithms, known as ellipsoid algorithms and interior-point algorithms, that solve \\nlinear programs in polynomial time. In addition, th e simplex algorithm is widely \\nused. Although it does not run in polynomial time i n the worst case, it tends to \\nperform well in practice. \\nWe will not give a detailed algorithm for linear programming, but will discuss a \\nfew important ideas. First, we will give an example of using a geometric procedure \\nto solve a two-variable linear program. Although this example does not immedi- \\nately generalize to an efûcient algorithm for larger problems, it introduces some \\nimportant concepts for linear programming and for optimization in general. \\nA two-variable linear program \\nLet us ûrst consider the following linear program with two variables: \\nmaximize x 1 C x 2 (29.17) \\nsubject to \\n4x 1 \\ue003 x 2 හ 8 (29.18) \\n2x 1 C x 2 හ 10 (29.19) \\n5x 1 \\ue003 2x 2 \\ue004 \\ue0032 (29.20) \\nx 1 ;x 2 \\ue004 0 : (29.21) \\nFigure 29.2(a) graphs the constraints in the .x 1 ;x 2 /-Cartesian coordinate system. \\nThe feasible region in the two-dimensional space (highlighted in blue in the ûg- \\nure) is convex. 1 Conceptually, you could evaluate the objective function x 1 C x 2 at \\neach point in the feasible region, and then identif y a point that has the maximum \\nobjective value as an optimal solution. For this ex ample (and for most linear pro- \\ngrams), however, the feasible region contains an inûnite number of points, and so \\nto solve this linear program, you need an efûcient way to ûnd a point that achieves \\nthe maximum objective value without explicitly eval uating the objective function \\nat every point in the feasible region. \\nIn two dimensions, you can optimize via a graphical procedure.

The \\nintersection of this line and the feasible region i s the set of feasible solutions that \\nhave an objective value of 0. In this case, that intersection of the line with the \\nfeasible region is the single point .0;0/.

(b) The red lines show, respectively, the points for which the objective value is 0, 4, and 8. \\nThe optimal solution to the linear program is x 1 D 2 and x 2 D 6 with objective value 8. \\nintersection of the line x 1 C x 2 D ´ and the feasible region is the set of feasible \\nsolutions that have objective value ´. Figure 29.2(b) shows the lines x 1 C x 2 D 0, \\nx 1 C x 2 D 4, and x 1 C x 2 D 8. Because the feasible region in Figure 29.2 is \\nbounded, there must be some maximum value ´ for which the intersection of the \\nline x 1 C x 2 D ´ and the feasible region is nonempty. Any point in t he feasible \\nregion that maximizes x 1 C x 2 is an optimal solution to the linear program, which \\nin this case is the vertex of the feasible region at x 1 D 2 and x 2 D 6, with objective \\nvalue 8. \\nIt is no accident that an optimal solution to the linear program occurs at a vertex \\nof the feasible region. The maximum value of ´ for which the line x 1 C x 2 D ´ \\nintersects the feasible region must be on the bound ary of the feasible region, and \\nthus the intersection of this line with the boundary of the feasible region is either a \\nsingle vertex or a line segment.

If the intersection is a line segment, \\nevery point on that line segment must have the same objective value. In particular, \\nboth endpoints of the line segment are optimal solutions. Since each endpoint of a \\nline segment is a vertex, there is an optimal solution at a vertex in this case as well. \\nAlthough you cannot easily graph linear programs with more than two variables, \\nthe same intuition holds.

The set of points for which the objective function \\nobtains a given value ´ is now a plane (assuming no degenerate conditions). If all \\ncoefûcients of the objective function are nonnegative, and if the origin is a feasible \\nsolution to the linear program, then as you move this plane away from the origin, in \\na direction normal to the objective function, you ûnd points of increasing objective \\nvalue. (If the origin is not feasible or if some coefûcients in the objective function \\nare negative, the intuitive picture becomes slightly more complicated.) As in two \\ndimensions, because the feasible region is convex, the set of points that achieve \\nthe optimal objective value must include a vertex o f the feas ible region. Simi- \\nlarly, if you have n variables, each constraint deûnes a half-space in n-dimensional \\nspace. We call the feasible region formed by the in tersection of these half-spaces \\na simplex. The objective function is now a hyperplane and, b ecause of convexity, \\nan optimal solution still occurs at a vertex of the simplex. Any algorithm for linear \\nprogramming must also identify linear programs that have no solutions, as well as \\nlinear programs that have no ûnite optimal solution. \\nThe simplex algorithm takes as input a linear program and returns an opti mal \\nsolution. It starts at some vertex of the simplex a nd performs a sequence of itera- \\ntions. In each iteration, it moves along an edge of the simplex from a current vertex \\nto a neighboring vertex whose objective value is no smaller than that of the current \\nvertex (and usually is larger.) The simplex algorit hm terminates when it reaches \\na local maximum, which is a vertex from which all n eighboring vertices have a \\nsmaller objective value. Because the feasible regio n is convex and the objective \\nfunction is linear, this local optimum is actually a global optimum. In Section 29.3, \\nwe’ll see an important concept called <duality,= which we’ll use to prove that the \\nsolution returned by the simplex algorithm is indeed optimal. \\nThe simplex algorithm, when implemented carefully, often solves general lin- \\near programs quickly in practice. With some careful ly contrived inputs, however, \\nthe simplex algorithm can require exponential time. The ûrst polynomial-time al- \\ngorithm for linear programming was the ellipsoid algorithm, which runs slowly \\nin practice. A second class of polynomial-time algorithms are known as interior- \\npoint methods. In contrast to the simplex algorithm, which moves  along the exte- \\nrior of the feasible region and maintains a feasibl e solution that is a vertex of the \\nsimplex at each iteration, these algorithms move through the interior of the feasible \\nregion. The intermediate solutions, while feasible,  are not necessarily vertices of \\nthe simplex, but the ûnal solution is a vertex. For large inputs, interior-point algo- \\nrithms can run as fast as, and sometimes faster tha n, the simplex algorithm. The \\nchapter notes point you to more information about these algorithms. \\nIf you add to a linear program the additional requi rement that all variables \\ntake on integer values, you have an integer linear program.

In \\nthis section, we’ll study how to formulate several graph and network-üow problems \\nas linear programs. Section 35.4 uses linear programming as a tool to ûnd an \\napproximate solution to another graph problem. \\nPerhaps the most important aspect of linear program ming is t o be able to rec- \\nognize when you can formulate a problem as a linear program. Once you cast a \\nproblem as a polynomial-sized linear program, you can solve it in polynomial time \\nby the ellipsoid algorithm or interior-point methods. Several linear-programming \\nsoftware packages can solve problems efûciently, so that once the problem is in the \\nform of a linear program, such a package can solve it. \\nWe’ll look at several concrete examples of linear-programming problems. We \\nstart with two problems that we have already studie d: the sin gle-source shortest- \\npaths problem from Chapter 22 and the maximum-üow problem from Chapter 24. \\nWe then describe the minimum-cost-üow problem. (Although the minimum-cost- \\nüow problem has a polynomial-time algorithm that is not based on linear program- \\nming, we won’t describe the algorithm.) Finally, we describe the multicommodity- \\nüow problem, for which the only known polynomial-time algorithm is based on \\nlinear programming. \\nWhen we solved graph problems in Part VI, we used a ttribute notation, such as \\nv: d and .u;v/: f . Linear programs typically use subscripted variabl es rather than '),\n",

Therefore, when we express variables in \\nlinear programs, we indicate vertices and edges thr ough subscripts. For example, \\nwe denote the shortest-path weight for vertex v not by v: d but by d v , and we denote \\nthe üow from vertex u to vertex v not by .u;v/: f but by f uv . For quantities that \\nare given as inputs to problems, such as edge weights or capacities, we continue to \\nuse notations such as w.u;v/ and c.u;v/. \\nShortest paths \\nWe can formulate the single-source shortest-paths problem as a linear program. \\nWe’ll focus on how to formulate the single-pair shortest-path problem, leaving \\nthe extension to the more general single-source shortest-paths problem as Exer- \\ncise 29.2-2. \\nIn the single-pair shortest-path problem, the input is a weighted, directed graph \\nG D .V;E/, with weight function w W E ! R mapping edges to real-valued \\nweights, a source vertex s , and destination vertex t . The goal is to compute the \\nvalue d t , which is the weight of a shortest path from s to t . To express this prob- \\nlem as a linear program, you need to determine a se t of variables and constraints \\nthat deûne when you have a shortest path from s to t . The triangle inequality \\n(Lemma 22.10 on page 633) gives d v හ d u C w.u;v/ for each edge .u;v/ 2 E. \\nThe source vertex initially receives a value d s D 0, which never changes. Thus the \\nfollowing linear program expresses the shortest-path weight from s to t : \\nmaximize d t (29.22) \\nsubject to \\nd v හ d u C w.u;v/ for each edge .u;v/ 2 E (29.23) \\nd s D 0 : (29.24) \\nYou might be surprised that this linear program max imizes an objective function \\nwhen it is supposed to compute shortest paths. Mini mizing the objective function \\nwould be a mistake, because when all the edge weigh ts are nonnegative, setting \\nN d v D 0 for all v 2 V (recall that a bar over a variable name denotes a speciûc \\nsetting of the variable’s value) would yield an optimal solution to the linear pro- \\ngram without solving the shortest-paths problem. Maximizing is the right thing \\nto do because an optimal solution to the shortest-paths problem sets each N d v to \\nmin \\n˚ N d u C w.u;v/ W u 2 V and .u;v/ 2 E \\n\\ue009 \\n, so that N d v is the largest value that is \\nless than or equal to all of the values in the set ˚ N d u C w.u;v/ \\ue009 . Therefore, it makes \\nsense to maximize d v for all vertices v on a shortest path from s to t subject to these \\nconstraints, and maximizing d t achieves this goal. \\nThis linear program has jV j variables d v , one for each vertex v 2 V . It also \\nhas jEj C 1 constraints: one for each edge, plus the additional  constraint that the \\nsource vertex’s shortest-path weight always has the value 0. '),\n",

Recall that \\nthe input is a directed graph G D .V;E/ in which each edge .u;v/ 2 E has a \\nnonnegative capacity c.u;v/ \\ue004 0, and two distinguished vertices: a source s and \\na sink t . As deûned in Section 24.1, a üow is a nonnegative real-valued function \\nf W V \\ue005 V ! R that satisûes the capacity constraint and üow conservation. A \\nmaximum üow is a üow that satisûes these constraints and maximizes the üow \\nvalue, which is the total üow coming out of the source minus the total üow into the \\nsource. A üow, therefore, satisûes linear constraints, and the value of a üow is a \\nlinear function. Recalling also that we assume that  c.u;v/ D 0 if .u;v/ … E and \\nthat there are no antiparallel edges, the maximum-üow problem can be expressed \\nas a linear program: \\nmaximize \\nX \\nv2V \\nf sv \\ue003 \\nX \\nv2V \\nf vs (29.25) \\nsubject to \\nf uv හ c.u;v/ for each u;v 2 V (29.26) X \\nv2V \\nf vu D \\nX \\nv2V \\nf uv for each u 2 V \\ue003 fs;t g (29.27) \\nf uv \\ue004 0 for each u;v 2 V : (29.28) \\nThis linear program has jV j 2 variables, corresponding to the üow between each \\npair of vertices, and it has 2 jV j 2 C jV j \\ue003 2 constraints. \\nIt is usually more efûcient to solve a smaller-sized linear program. The linear \\nprogram in (29.25)3(29.28) has, for ease of notation, a üow and capacity of 0 for \\neach pair of vertices u;v with .u;v/ … E. It is more efûcient to rewrite the linear \\nprogram so that it has O.V C E/ constraints. Exercise 29.2-4 asks you to do so. \\nMinimum-cost üow \\nIn this section, we have used linear programming to  solve problems for which we \\nalready knew efûcient algorithms. In fact, an efûcient algorithm designed specif- \\nically for a problem, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm for the single-source shortest- \\npaths problem, will often be more efûcient than linear programming, both in theory \\nand in practice. \\nThe real power of linear programming comes from the ability to solve new prob- \\nlems. Recall the problem faced by the politician in  the beginning of this chapter. \\nThe problem of obtaining a sufûcient number of votes, while not spending too \\nmuch money, is not solved by any of the algorithms that we have studied in this \\nbook, yet it can be solved by linear programming.

Any feasible solution to the primal \\nmust satisfy this new constraint, but there is some thing else interesting about it. \\nComparing this new constraint to the objective func tion (29.37), you can see that \\nfor each variable, the corresponding coefûcient is at least as large as the coefûcient \\nin the objective function.

For an excellent introduction \\nto signal processing, a popular FFT application are a, see th e texts by Oppenheim \\nand Schafer [347] and Oppenheim and Willsky [348]. The Oppenheim and Schafer \\nbook also shows how to handle cases in which n is not an exact power of 2. \\nFourier analysis is not limited to 1-dimensional data. It is widely used in image \\nprocessing to analyze data in two or more dimension s. The boo ks by Gonzalez \\nand Woods [194] and Pratt [363] discuss multidimensional Fourier transforms and \\ntheir use in image processing, and books by Tolimie ri, An, and Lu [439] and Van \\nLoan [442] discuss the mathematics of multidimensional fast Fourier transforms. \\nCooley and Tukey [101] are widely credited with devising the FFT in the 1960s. \\nThe FFT had in fact been discovered many times previously, but its importance was \\nnot fully realized before the advent of modern digi tal computers. Although Press, \\nTeukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery attribute the o rigins of the method to Runge \\nand K¨ onig in 1924, an article by Heideman, Johnson, and Burrus [211] traces the \\nhistory of the FFT as far back as C. F. Gauss in 1805. \\nFrigo and Johnson [161] developed a fast and üexible implementation of the \\nFFT, called FFTW (<fastest Fourier transform in the West=). FFTW is designed for \\nsituations requiring multiple DFT computations on the same problem size. Before \\nactually computing the DFTs, FFTW executes a <plann er,= which, by a series of \\ntrial runs, determines how best to decompose the FF T computation for the given \\nproblem size on the host machine. FFTW adapts to us e the hardw are cache ef- \\nûciently, and once subproblems are small enough, FFTW solves them with opti- \\nmized, straight-line code. Moreover, FFTW has the advantage of taking ‚.n lg n/ \\ntime for any problem size n, even when n is a large prime. \\nAlthough the standard Fourier transform assumes that the input represents points \\nthat are uniformly spaced in the time domain, other techniques can approximate the \\nFFT on <nonequispaced= data.

Today number-theoretic algorithms are used widely, due in large part \\nto the invention of cryptographic schemes based on large prime numbers. These \\nschemes are feasible because we can ûnd large primes quickly , and they are secure \\nbecause we do not know how to factor the product of large primes (or solve related \\nproblems, such as computing discrete logarithms) efûciently. This chapter presents \\nsome of the number theory and related algorithms that underlie such applications. \\nWe start in Section 31.1 by introducing basic concepts of number theory, such \\nas divisibility, modular equivalence, and unique prime factorization. Section 31.2 \\nstudies one of the world’s oldest algorithms: Euclid’s algorithm for computing \\nthe greatest common divisor of two integers, and Section 31.3 reviews concepts \\nof modular arithmetic. Section 31.4 then explores the set of multiples of a given \\nnumber a, modulo n, and shows how to ûnd all solutions to the equation ax D b \\n.mod n/ by using Euclid’s algorithm. The Chinese remainder theorem is presented \\nin Section 31.5. Section 31.6 considers powers of a given number a, modulo n, \\nand presents a repeated-squaring algorithm for efûciently computing a b mod n, \\ngiven a, b, and n. This operation is at the heart of efûcient primality testing and of \\nmuch modern cryptography, such as the RSA public-key cryptosystem described in \\nSection 31.7. We wrap up in Section 31.8, which examines a randomized primality \\ntest. This test ûnds large primes efûciently, an essential step in creating keys for \\nthe RSA cryptosystem. \\nSize of inputs and cost of arithmetic computations \\nBecause we’ll be working with large integers, we need to adjust how to think about \\nthe size of an input and about the cost of elementary arithmetic operations. \\nIn this chapter, a <large input= typically means an  input con taining <large in- \\ntegers= rather than an input containing <many integ ers= (as for sorting). Thus, \\nthe size of an input depends on the number of bits required to represent that in- \\nput, not just the number of integers in the input. An algorithm with integer in- '),\n",

Counting the number of such arithmetic operations that an algorithm per- \\nforms provides a basis for making a reasonable esti mate of the algorithm’s actual \\nrunning time on a computer. Elementary operations can be time-consuming, how- \\never, when their inputs are large. It thus becomes appropriate to measure how many \\nbit operations a number-theoretic algorithm requires. In this model, multiplying \\ntwo ˇ-bit integers by the ordinary method uses ‚.ˇ 2 / bit operations. Similarly, di- \\nviding a ˇ-bit integer by a shorter integer or taking the remainder of a ˇ-bit integer \\nwhen divided by a shorter integer requires ‚.ˇ 2 / time by simple algorithms. (See \\nExercise 31.1-12.) Faster methods are known. For example, a simple divide-and- \\nconquer method for multiplying two ˇ-bit integers has a running time of ‚.ˇ lg 3 /, \\nand O.ˇ lg ˇ lg lg ˇ/ time is possible. For practical purposes, however, the ‚.ˇ 2 / \\nalgorithm is often best, and we use this bound as a  basis for our analyses. In this \\nchapter, we’ll usually analyze algorithms in terms of both the number of arithmetic \\noperations and the number of bit operations they require. \\n31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions \\nThis section provides a brief review of notions fro m elementary number theory \\nconcerning the set Z D f :::;  \\ue0032; \\ue0031;0;1;2;:::  g of integers and the set N D \\nf0;1;2;::: g of natural numbers. \\nDivisibility and divisors \\nThe notion of one integer being divisible by another is key to the theory of numbers. \\nThe notation d j a (read <d divides a=) means that a D kd for some integer k. \\nEvery integer divides 0. If a>0  and d j a, then jd j හ jaj. If d j a, then we also \\nsay that a is a multiple of d . If d does not divide a, we write d − a. \\nIf d j a and d \\ue004 0, then d is a divisor of a. Since d j a if and only if \\ue003d j a, \\nwithout loss of generality, we deûne the divisors of a to be nonnegative, with the \\nunderstanding that the negative of any divisor of a also divides a. A divisor of a \\nnonzero integer a is at least 1 but not greater than jaj. For example, the divisors \\nof 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \\nEvery positive integer a is divisible by the trivial divisors 1 and a. The nontrivial \\ndivisors of a are the factors of a. For example, the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10. '),\n",

Primes have many special properties and play a \\ncritical role in number theory. The ûrst 20 primes, in order, are \\n2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61; 67; 71 : \\nExercise 31.1-2 asks you to prove that there are inûnitely many primes. An integer \\na>1  that is not prime is a composite number or, more simply, a composite. For \\nexample, 39 is composite because 3 j 39. We call the integer 1 a unit, and it is \\nneither prime nor composite. Similarly, the integer  0 and all negative integers are \\nneither prime nor composite. \\nThe division theorem, remainders, and modular equivalence \\nGiven an integer n, we can partition the integers into those that are  multiples of n \\nand those that are not multiples of n. Much number theory is based upon reûning \\nthis partition by classifying the integers that are  not multiples of n according to \\ntheir remainders when divided by n. The following theorem provides the basis for \\nthis reûnement. We omit the proof (but see, for example, Niven and Zuckerman \\n[345]). \\nTheorem 31.1 (Division theorem) \\nFor any integer a and any positive integer n, there exist unique integers q and r \\nsuch that 0 හ r <n and a D qn C r . \\nThe value q D ba=nc is the quotient of the division. The value r D a mod n is \\nthe remainder (or residue) of the division, so that n j a if and only if a mod n D 0. \\nThe integers partition into n equivalence classes according to their remainders \\nmodulo n. The equivalence class modulo n containing an integer a is \\nŒa� n D fa C kn W k 2 Zg : \\nFor example, Œ3� 7 D f:::;  \\ue00311; \\ue0034;3;10;17;:::  g, and Œ\\ue0034� 7 and Œ10� 7 also denote \\nthis set.

This problem has several applications. For example, we’ll \\nuse it in Section 31.7 as part of the procedure to ûnd keys in the RSA public-key \\ncryptosystem. We assume that a, b, and n are given, and we wish to ûnd all values \\nof x , modulo n, that satisfy equation (31.26). The equation may have zero, one, or \\nmore than one such solution. \\nLet hai denote the subgroup of Z n generated by a. Since hai D fa .x/ W x>0 g D \\nfax mod n W x>0 g, equation (31.26) has a solution if and only if Œb� 2 h ai. \\nLagrange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) tells us that jhaij must be a divisor of n. \\nThe following theorem gives us a precise characterization of hai. \\nTheorem 31.20 \\nFor any positive integers a and n, if d D gcd.a;n/, then we have \\nhai D h d i \\nD f 0;d;2d;:::;..n=d/  \\ue003 1/d g \\nin Z n , and thus \\njhaij D n=d : \\nProof We begin by showing that d 2 hai. Recall that EXTENDED -EUCLID .a;n/ \\nreturns a triple .d;x;y/  such that ax C ny D d . Thus, ax D d .mod n/, so that \\nd 2 hai. In other words, d is a multiple of a in Z n . \\nSince d 2 hai, it follows that every multiple of d belongs to hai, because any \\nmultiple of a multiple of a is itself a multiple of a. Thus, hai contains every element \\nin f0;d;2d;:::;..n=d/  \\ue003 1/d g. That is, hd i ෂ hai. \\nWe now show that hai ෂ h d i.

Therefore, m 2 hd i. \\nCombining these results, we have that hai D h d i.

E., the Chinese mathematician Sun-Ts˘ u solved the problem of ûnd- \\ning those integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 re- \\nspectively. One such solution is x D 23, and all solutions are of the form 23 C105k \\nfor arbitrary integers k. The <Chinese remainder theorem= provides a correspon- \\ndence between a system of equations modulo a set of  pairwise relatively prime \\nmoduli (for example, 3, 5, and 7) and an equation modulo their product (for exam- \\nple, 105). \\nThe Chinese remainder theorem has two major applica tions. L et the inte- \\nger n be factored as n D n 1 n 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 n k , where the factors n i are pairwise relatively \\nprime.

Second, this description helps in des igning efûcient algo- \\nrithms, since working in each of the systems Z n i can be more efûcient (in terms of \\nbit operations) than working modulo n. \\nTheorem 31.27 (Chinese remainder theorem) \\nLet n D n 1 n 2 \\ue001 \\ue001 \\ue001 n k , where the n i are pairwise relatively prime.

Modular exponenti- \\nation is an essential operation in many primality-testing routines and in the RSA \\npublic-key cryptosystem.

If an adversary can factor the modulus n in a public key, then \\nthe adversary can derive the secret key from the pu blic key, using the knowledge \\nof the factors p and q in the same way that the creator of the public key used them. \\nTherefore, if factoring large integers is easy, then breaking the RSA cryptosystem \\nis easy. The converse statement, that if factoring large integers is hard, then break- \\ning RSA is hard, is unproven. After two decades of research, however, no easier \\nmethod has been found to break the RSA public-key cryptosystem than to factor \\nthe modulus n. And factoring large integers is surprisingly difûcult. By randomly \\nselecting and multiplying together two 1024-bit primes, you can create a public key \\nthat cannot be <broken= in any feasible amount of time with current technology. In \\nthe absence of a fundamental breakthrough in the de sign of nu mber-theoretic al- \\ngorithms, and when implemented with care following recommended standards, the \\nRSA cryptosystem is capable of providing a high degree of security in applications. \\nIn order to achieve security with the RSA cryptosys tem, however, you should \\nuse integers that are quite long4more than 1000 bits4to resist possible advances \\nin the art of factoring. In 2021, RSA moduli are commonly in the range of 2048 \\nto 4096 bits. To create moduli of such sizes, you must ûnd large primes efûciently. \\nSection 31.8 addresses this problem. \\nFor efûciency, RSA is often used in a <hybrid= or <key-management= mode with \\nfast cryptosystems that are not public-key cryptosystems. With such a symmetric- \\nkey system, the encryption and decryption keys are iden tical. If Alice wishes to \\nsend a long message M to Bob privately, she selects a random key K for the fast \\nsymmetric-key cryptosystem and encrypts M using K, obtaining ciphertext C , \\nwhere C is as long as M , but K is quite short. Then she encrypts K using Bob’s \\npublic RSA key. Since K is short, computing P B .K/ is fast (much faster than \\ncomputing P B .M/).

The geometric distribution says how many trials m ust occur \\nto obtain a success, and by equation (C.36) on page 1197, the expected number \\nof trials is approximately ln n. Thus, in order to ûnd a prime that has the same \\nlength as n by testing integers chosen randomly near n, the expected number ex- \\namined would be approximately ln n. For example, the expectation is that ûnding a \\n1024-bit prime would require testing approximately ln 2 1024 \\ue002 710 randomly cho- \\nsen 1024-bit numbers for primality.

We can conclude that n is prime if and only if none of the trial divisors \\ndivides n. Assuming that each trial division takes constant time, the worst-case \\nrunning time is ‚. p n/, which is exponential in the length of n. (Recall that if n \\nis encoded in binary using ˇ bits, then ˇ D dlg.n C 1/e, and so p n D ‚.2 ˇ=2 /.) \\nThus, trial division works well only if n is very small or happens to have a small \\nprime factor. When it works, trial division has the advantage that it not only deter- \\nmines whether n is prime or composite, it also determines one of n’s prime factors \\nif n is composite. \\nThis section focuses on ûnding out whether a given number n is prime. If n \\nis composite, we won’t worry about ûnding its prime factorization. Computing \\nthe prime factorization of a number is computationa lly expensive. You might be \\nsurprised that it turns out to be much easier to as certain whether a given number \\nis prime than it is to determine the prime factoriz ation of the number if it is not \\nprime. \\nPseudoprimality testing \\nWe’ll start with a method for primality testing that <almost works= and, in fact, is \\ngood enough for many practical applications. Later on, we’ll reûne this method to \\nremove the small defect. Let Z C \\nn denote the nonzero elements of Z n : \\nZ C \\nn D f1;2;:::;n  \\ue003 1g : \\nIf n is prime, then Z C \\nn D Z \\ue003 \\nn . \\nWe say that n is a \\nbase-a pseudoprime if n is composite and \\na n\\ue0021 D 1 .mod n/: (31.39) \\nFermat’s theorem (Theorem 31.31 on page 932) implies that if n is prime, then n \\nsatisûes equation (31.39) for every a in Z C \\nn . Thus, if there is any a 2 Z C \\nn such that \\nn does not satisfy equation (31.39), then n is certainly composite. Surprisingly, \\nthe converse almost holds, so that this criterion forms an almost perfe ct test for \\nprimality. Instead of trying every value of a 2 Z C \\nn , test to see whether n satisûes \\nequation (31.39) for just a D 2. If not, then declare n to be composite by returning \\nCOMPOSITE . Otherwise, return PRIME , guessing that n is prime (when, in fact, all \\nwe know is that n is either prime or a base-2 pseudoprime). \\nThe procedure PSEUDOPRIME  on the next page pretends in this manner to check \\nwhether n is prime. It uses the procedure M ODULAR -EXPONENTIATION  from \\nSection 31.6. It assumes that the input n is an odd integer greater than 2. This pro- \\ncedure can make errors, but only of one type. That is, if it says that n is composite, \\nthen it is always correct. If it says that n is prime, however, then it makes an error \\nonly if n is a base-2 pseudoprime. \\nHow often does PSEUDOPRIME  err? Surprisingly rarely.

Using more \\nprecise estimates due to Pomerance [361] of the number of base-2 pseudoprimes \\nof a given size, a randomly chosen 512-bit number that is called prime by PSEU - \\nDOPRIME  has less than one chance in 10 20 of being a base-2 pseudoprime, and a \\nrandomly chosen 1024-bit number that is called prime has less than one chance in \\n10 41 of being a base-2 pseudoprime. Thus, if you are merely trying to ûnd a large \\nprime for some application, for all practical purpo ses you almost never go wrong \\nby choosing large numbers at random until one of th em causes P SEUDOPRIME  to \\nreturn PRIME . But when the numbers being tested for primality a re not randomly \\nchosen, you might need a better approach for testing primality.

If n is prime, however, Fermat’s theorem (Theorem 31.31) \\nsays that a n\\ue0021 D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z \\ue003 \\nn . Since Z C \\nn D Z \\ue003 \\nn if n is prime, Fermat’s \\ntheorem also says that a n\\ue0021 D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z C \\nn . Therefore, n cannot be \\nprime, and the equation a n\\ue0021 mod n ¤ 1 proves this fact. \\nIf WITNESS returns TRUE from line 6, then it has discovered that x i \\ue0021 is a non- \\ntrivial square root of 1, modulo n, since we have that x i \\ue0021 ¤ Û 1 .mod n/ yet \\nx i D x 2 \\ni \\ue0021 D 1 .mod n/. Corollary 31.35 on page 934 states that only if n is com- \\nposite can there exist a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, so that demonstrating \\nthat x i \\ue0021 is a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n proves that n is composite. \\nThus, if the call W ITNESS .a;n/ returns TRUE , then n is surely composite, and \\nthe witness a, along with the reason that the procedure returns TRUE (did it return \\nfrom line 6 or from line 8?), provides a proof that n is composite. \\nLet’s explore an alternative view of the behavior of WITNESS as a function of \\nthe sequence X D hx 0 ;x 1 ;:::;x  t i.

As before, assume that n is an odd integer greater than 2. \\nThe procedure M ILLER -RABIN is a probabilistic search for a proof that n is \\ncomposite. The main loop (beginning on line 1) picks up to s random values of a \\nfrom Z C \\nn , except for 1 and n \\ue003 1 (line 2). If it picks a value of a that is a witness to \\nthe compositeness of n, then MILLER -RABIN returns COMPOSITE  on line 4. Such \\na result is always correct, by the correctness of WITNESS . If M ILLER -RABIN ûnds \\nno witness in s trials, then the procedure assumes that it found no witness because \\nno witnesses exist, and therefore it assumes that n is prime. We’ll see that this \\nresult is likely to be correct if s is large enough, but there is still a tiny chance that \\nthe procedure could be unlucky in its choice of s random values of a, so that even \\nthough the procedure failed to ûnd a witness, at least one witness exists. \\nTo illustrate the operation of M ILLER -RABIN , let n be the Carmichael num- \\nber 561, so that n \\ue003 1 D 560 D 2 4 \\ue001 35, t D 4, and u D 35. If the procedure \\nchooses a D 7 as a base, the column for b D 35 in Figure 31.4 (Section 31.6) \\nshows that W ITNESS computes x 0 D a 35 D 241 . mod 561/. Because of how \\nthe M ODULAR -EXPONENTIATION  procedure operates recursively on its param- \\neter b, the ûrst four columns in Figure 31.4 represent the factor 2 4 of 5604the \\nrightmost four zeros in the binary representation of 5604reading these four zeros \\nfrom right to left in the binary representation. Th us W ITNESS computes the se- \\nquence X D h 241; 298; 166; 67; 1 i. Then, in the last squaring step, W ITNESS \\ndiscovers that a 280 is a nontrivial square root of 1 since a 280 D 67 . mod n/ and \\n.a 280 / 2 D a 560 D 1 .mod n/. Therefore, a D 7 is a witness to the compositeness \\nof n, WITNESS .7;n/ returns TRUE , and MILLER -RABIN returns COMPOSITE . \\nIf n is a ˇ-bit number, MILLER -RABIN requires O.sˇ/ arithmetic operations \\nand O.sˇ 3 / bit operations, since it requires asymptotically no  more work than s \\nmodular exponentiations. \\nError rate of the Miller-Rabin primality test \\nIf MILLER -RABIN returns PRIME , then there is a very slim chance that it has made \\nan error.

Moreover, since each test is \\nmore stringent than a simple check of equation (31.39), we can expect on general \\nprinciples that the error rate should be small for randomly chosen integers n. The \\nfollowing theorem presents a more precise argument. \\nTheorem 31.39 \\nIf n is an odd composite number, then the number of witn esses to th e composite- \\nness of n is at least .n \\ue003 1/=2. \\nProof The proof shows that the number of nonwitnesses is at most .n \\ue003 1/=2, \\nwhich implies the theorem. \\nWe start by claiming that any nonwitness must be a member of Z \\ue003 \\nn . Why? \\nConsider any nonwitness a. It must satisfy a n\\ue0021 D 1 .mod n/ or, equivalently, \\na \\ue001 a n\\ue0022 D 1 .mod n/. Thus the equation ax D 1 .mod n/ has a solution, \\nnamely a n\\ue0022 . By Corollary 31.21 on page 924, gcd.a;n/ j 1, which in turn implies \\nthat gcd.a;n/ D 1. Therefore, a is a member of Z \\ue003 \\nn , and all nonwitnesses belong \\nto Z \\ue003 \\nn . \\nTo complete the proof, we show that not only are al l nonwitnesses contained \\nin Z \\ue003 \\nn , they are all contained in a proper subgroup B of Z \\ue003 \\nn (recall that B is a \\nproper subgroup of Z \\ue003 \\nn when B is subgroup of Z \\ue003 \\nn but B is not equal to Z \\ue003 \\nn ). By \\nCorollary 31.16 on page 921, we then have jB j හ jZ \\ue003 \\nn j=2. Since jZ \\ue003 \\nn j හ n \\ue003 1, we \\nobtain jB j හ .n \\ue003 1/=2. Therefore, if all nonwitnesses are contained in a  proper \\nsubgroup of Z \\ue003 \\nn , then the number of nonwitnesses is at most .n \\ue003 1/=2, so that the \\nnumber of witnesses must be at least .n \\ue003 1/=2. \\nTo ûnd a proper subgroup B of Z \\ue003 \\nn containing all of the nonwitnesses, we con- \\nsider two cases. \\nCase 1: There exists an x 2 Z \\ue003 \\nn such that \\nx n\\ue0021 ¤ 1 .mod n/: \\nIn other words, n is not a Carmichael number.

The proof of Theorem 31.40 is a slight adaptation of \\none suggested by Bach [32]. A proof of a stronger result for MILLER -RABIN \\nwas given by Monier [332, 333]. For many years primality-testing was the classic \\nexample of a problem where randomization appeared t o be necessary to obtain \\nan efûcient (polynomial-time) algorithm. In 2002, however, Agrawal, Kayal, and \\nSaxena [4] surprised everyone with their deterministic polynomial-time primality- \\ntesting algorithm. Until then, the fastest determin istic primality testing algorithm \\nknown, due to Cohen and Lenstra [97], ran in .lg n/ O.lg lg lg n/ time on input n, which \\nis just slightly superpolynomial. Nonetheless, for practical purposes, randomized \\nprimality-testing algorithms remain more efûcient and are generally preferred. \\nBeauchemin, Brassard, Cr´ epeau, Goutier, and Pomerance [40] nicely discuss the \\nproblem of ûnding large <random= primes. \\nThe concept of a public-key cryptosystem is due to Difûe and Hellman [115]. \\nThe RSA cryptosystem was proposed in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman \\n[380]. Since then, the ûeld of cryptography has blossomed. Our understanding of \\nthe RSA cryptosystem has deepened, and modern implementations use signiûcant \\nreûnements of the basic techniques presented here. In addition, many new tech- \\nniques have been developed for proving cryptosystems to be secure. For example, \\nGoldwasser and Micali [190] show that randomization can be an effective tool in \\nthe design of secure public-key encryption schemes. For signature schemes, Gold- \\nwasser, Micali, and Rivest [191] present a digital-signature scheme for which every \\nconceivable type of forgery is provably as difûcult as factoring. Katz and Lindell \\n[253] provide an overview of modern cryptography. \\nThe best algorithms for factoring large numbers have a running time that grows \\nroughly exponentially with the cube root of the len gth of the number n to be fac- \\ntored. The general number-ûeld sieve factoring algorithm (as developed by Buh- \\nler, Lenstra, and Pomerance [77] as an extension of the ideas in the number-ûeld \\nsieve factoring algorithm by Pollard [360] and Lenstra et al. [295] and reûned by \\nCoppersmith [102] and others) is perhaps the most efûcient such algorithm in gen- \\neral for large inputs.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses ‚.m/ prepro- \\ncessing time, and its worst-case running time is ‚..n \\ue003 m C 1/m/. Based on certain \\nassumptions, however, its average-case running time is better. \\nThis algorithm makes use of elementary number-theoretic notions such as the \\nequivalence of two numbers modulo a third number. Y ou might want to refer to \\nSection 31.1 for the relevant deûnitions. \\nFor expository purposes, let’s assume that † D f 0; 1; 2;:::;  9g, so that each \\ncharacter is a decimal digit. (In the general case,  you can as sume that each char- \\nacter is a digit in radix-d notation, so that it has a numerical value in the r ange 0 \\nto d \\ue0031, where d D j†j.) You can then view a string of k consecutive characters as \\nrepresenting a length-k decimal number. For example, the character string 31415 \\ncorresponds to the decimal number 31,415. Because we interpret the input char- \\nacters as both graphical symbols and digits, it will be convenient in this section to \\ndenote them as digits in standard text font. \\nGiven a pattern PŒ1 W m�, let p denote its corresponding decimal value. In a \\nsimilar manner, given a text TŒ1 W n�, let t s denote the decimal value of the length-m \\nsubstring TŒs C 1 W s C m�, for s D 0;1;:::;n  \\ue003 m. Certainly, t s D p if and only \\nif TŒs C 1 W s C m� D PŒ1 W m�, and thus, s is a valid shift if and only if t s D p. If \\nyou could compute p in ‚.m/ time and all the t s values in a total of ‚.n \\ue003 m C 1/ \\ntime, 2 then you could determine all valid shifts s in ‚.m/ C ‚.n \\ue003 m C 1/ D ‚.n/ \\n2 We write ‚.n \\ue003 m C 1/ instead of ‚.n \\ue003 m/ because s takes on n \\ue003 m C 1 different values.

For example, suppose that m D 5, \\nt s D 31415, and the new low-order digit is TŒs C 5 C 1� D 2.

Thus, you ca n compute p in ‚.m/ time, \\nand you can compute all of t 0 ;t 1 ;:::;t  n\\ue002m in ‚.n \\ue003 m C 1/ time. Therefore, \\nyou can ûnd all occurrences of the pattern PŒ1 W m� in the text TŒ1 W n� with ‚.m/ \\npreprocessing time and ‚.n \\ue003 m C 1/ matching time. \\nThis scheme works well if P is short enough and the alphabet † is small enough \\nthat arithmetic operations on p and t s take constant time. But what if P is long, or if \\nthe size of † means that instead of powers of 10 in equation (32.1) you have to use \\npowers of a larger number (such as powers of 256 for the extended ASCII character \\nset)? Then the values of p and t s might be too large to work with in constant time. \\nFortunately, this problem can be solved, as Figure 32.4 shows: compute p and \\nthe t s values modulo a suitable modulus q.

This section presents a method for building such an automaton. These \\nstring-matching automata are efûcient: they examine each text character exactly \\nonce, taking constant time per text character. The matc hing time used4after pre- \\nprocessing the pattern to build the automaton4is therefore ‚.n/. The time to build \\nthe automaton, however, can be large if † is large. Section 32.4 describes a clever \\nway around this problem. \\nWe begin this section with the deûnition of a ûnite automaton. We then examine \\na special string-matching automaton and show how to use it to ûnd occurrences of a \\npattern in a text. Finally, we’ll see how to construct the string-matching automaton \\nfor a given input pattern. \\nFinite automata \\nA \\nûnite automaton M , illustrated in Figure 32.5, is a 5-tuple .Q;q 0 ;A;†;ı/ , \\nwhere \\n\\ue001 Q is a ûnite set of \\nstates, \\n\\ue001 q 0 2 Q is the start state, \\n\\ue001 A ෂ Q is a distinguished set of accepting states, \\n\\ue001 † is a ûnite input alphabet, \\n\\ue001 ı is a function from Q \\ue005 † into Q, called the transition function of M .

For example, the edge from state 1 to state 0 labeled b indicates that ı.1; b/ D 0. This \\nautomaton accepts those strings that end in an odd number of a’s. More precisely, it accepts a string x \\nif and only if x D y´, where y D \" or y ends with a b, and ´ D a k , where k is odd. For example, on \\ninput abaaa, including the start state, this automaton enters the sequence of states h0;1;0;1;0;1 i, \\nand so it accepts this input. For input abbaa, it enters the sequence of states h0;1;0;0;1;0 i, and so \\nit rejects this input. \\nThe ûnite automaton begins in state q 0 and reads the characters of its input string \\none at a time. If the automaton is in state q and reads input character a, it moves \\n(<makes a transition=) from state q to state ı.q;a/. Whenever its current state q is \\na member of A, the machine M has accepted the string read so far. An input that \\nis not accepted is rejected. \\nA ûnite automaton M induces a function �, called the ûnal-state function, \\nfrom † \\ue003 to Q such that �.w/ is the state M ends up in after reading the string w. \\nThus, M accepts a string w if and only if �.w/ 2 A.

The start state q 0 is state 0, and state m is the \\nonly accepting state. \\n\\ue001 The transition function ı is deûned, for any state q and character a, by \\nı.q;a/ D �.P Œ  W q�a/: (32.4) \\nAs the automaton consumes characters of the text T , it is trying to build a match \\nof the pattern P against the most recently seen characters of T . At any time, the \\nstate number q gives the length of the longest preûx of P that matches the most \\nrecently seen text characters. Whenever the automat on reaches state m, the m \\nmost recently seen text characters match the ûrst m characters of P . Since P has \\nlength m, reaching state m means that the m most recently seen text characters \\nmatch the entire pattern, so that the automaton has found a match. \\nWith this intuition behind the design of the automaton, here is the reasoning be- \\nhind deûning ı.q;a/ D �.P Œ  W q�a/. Suppose that the automaton is in state q after \\nreading the ûrst i characters of the text, that is, q D �.T Œ W i�/. The intuitive idea \\nthen says that q also equals the length of the longest preûx of P that matches \\na sufûx of TŒ W i� or, equivalently, that q D �.T Œ  W i�/. Thus, since �.T Œ W i�/ \\nand �.T Œ  W i�/ both equal q, we will see (in Theorem 32.4 on page 973) that the \\nautomaton maintains the following invariant: \\n�.T Œ W i�/ D �.T Œ  W i�/: (32.5) \\nIf the automaton is in state q and reads the next character TŒi C 1� D a, then the \\ntransition should lead to the state corresponding to the longest preûx of P that is a \\nsufûx of TŒ W i�a. That state is �.T Œ  W i�a/, and equation (32.5) gives �.T Œ W i�a/ D \\n�.T Œ  W i�a/. Because PŒ W q� is the longest preûx of P that is a sufûx of TŒ W i�, the \\nlongest preûx of P that is a sufûx of TŒ W i�a has length not only �.T Œ  W i�a/, but \\nalso �.P Œ  W q�a/, and so �.T Œ W i�a/ D �.P Œ  W q�a/. (Lemma 32.3 on page 972 will \\nprove that �.T Œ  W i�a/ D �.P Œ  W q�a/.) Thus, when the automaton is in state q, the \\ntransition function ı on character a should take the automaton to state ı.q;a/ D \\nı.�.T Œ  W i�/;a/ D �.T Œ W i�a/ D �.P Œ  W q�a/ (with the last equality following from \\nequation (32.5)). \\nThere are two cases to consider, depending on wheth er the nex t character con- \\ntinues to match the pattern. In the ûrst case, a D PŒq C 1�, so that the charac- \\nter a continues to match the pattern. In this case, becau se ı.q;a/ D q C 1, the \\ntransition continues to go along the <spine= of the  automaton (the blue edges in \\nFigure 32.6(a)). In the second case, a ¤ PŒq C 1�, so that a does not extend the \\nmatch being built. In this case, we need to ûnd the longest preûx of P that is also a \\nsufûx of TŒ W i�a, which will have length at most q. The preprocessing step matches \\nthe pattern against itself when creating the string-matching automaton, so that the \\ntransition function can quickly identify the longest such smaller preûx of P .

The KMP algorithm takes advantage of this infor- \\nmation to avoid testing useless shifts in the naive pattern-matching algorithm and to \\navoid precomputing the full transition function ı for a string-matching automaton. \\nConsider the operation of the naive string matcher. Figure 32.9(a) shows a par- \\nticular shift s of a template containing the pattern P D ababaca against a text T . \\nFor this example, q D 5 of the characters have matched successfully, but th e 6th \\npattern character fails to match the corresponding text cha racter.

Because these q text characters match, certain shifts must be inval id. \\nIn the example of the ûgure, the shift s C 1 is necessarily invalid, since the ûrst \\npattern character (a) would be aligned with a text character that does not match the \\nûrst pattern character, but does match the second pattern character (b).

You want to shift P so that some shorter \\npreûx PŒ W k� of P matches a sufûx of TŒ W s C q�, if possible. You might have more \\nthan one choice for how much to shift, however. In Figure 32.9(b), shifting P by 2 \\npositions works, so that PŒ W 3� h TŒ W s C q�, but so does shifting P by 4 positions, \\nso that PŒ W 1� h TŒ W s C q� in Figure 32.9(c). If more than one shift amount works, \\nyou should choose the smallest shift amount so that you do not miss any potential \\nmatches. Put more precisely, you want to answer this question: \\nGiven that pattern characters PŒ1 W q� match text characters TŒs C 1 W s C q� \\n(that is, PŒ W q� h TŒ W s C q�), what is the least shift s 0 > s such that for \\nsome k<q , \\nPŒ1 W k� D TŒs 0 C 1 W s 0 C k�; (32.6) \\n(that is, PŒ W k� h TŒ W s 0 C k�), where s 0 C k D s C q? \\nHere’s another way to look at this question. If you know PŒ W q� h TŒ W s C q�, \\nthen how do you ûnd the longest proper preûx PŒ W k� of PŒ W q� that is also a sufûx \\nof TŒ W s C q�? These questions are equivalent because given s and q, requiring \\ns 0 C k D s C q means that ûnding the smallest shift s 0 (2 in Figure 32.9(b)) is \\ntantamount to ûnding the longest preûx length k (3 in Figure 32.9(b)). If you add \\nthe difference q \\ue003 k in the lengths of these preûxes of P to the shift s , you get the \\nnew shift s 0 , so that s 0 D s C .q \\ue003 k/. In the best case, k D 0, so that s 0 D s C q, \\nimmediately ruling out shifts s C 1;s C 2;:::;s  C q \\ue003 1. In any case, at the new \\nshift s 0 , it is redundant to compare the ûrst k characters of P with the corresponding \\ncharacters of T , since equation (32.6) guarantees that they match. \\nAs Figure 32.9(d) demonstrates, you can precompute the necessary information \\nby comparing the pattern against itself. Since TŒs 0 C 1 W s 0 C k� is part of the \\nmatched portion of the text, it is a sufûx of the string PŒ W q�. Therefore, think \\nof equation (32.6) as asking for the greatest k < q such that PŒ W k� h PŒ W q�. \\nThen, the new shift s 0 D s C .q \\ue003 k/ is the next potentially valid shift. It will be \\nconvenient to store, for each value of q, the number k of matching characters at the \\nnew shift s 0 , rather than storing, say, the amount s 0 \\ue003 s to shift by. \\nLet’s look at the precomputed information a little more formally.
